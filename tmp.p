(S'We stayed with four people at Ted s apartment for 5 days and it was great Ted made sure we were well informed and with his description it was really easy to find the apartment although we hadn t been at this part of New York yet When we arrived Ted left a personal letter with detailed information about the area and also during our stay Ted was eager to give us tips The apartment is very big and makes you immediately feel at home We spent quite some hours on the roof terrace since the view was just stunning Also the neighborhood is really friendly We would definitely recommend staying at Ted s place'
p0
S'Ted was an awesome host he received us with 2 bottles of wine and he was super friendly the apartment is very close to the sub station it was clean and we had everything we needed We felt like we were home I don t think I will ever go to a hotel again lol Will contact Ted again if I need a place to stay in NYC again'
p1
S'Ted was accommodating and flexible in letting us use his beautiful apartment It has views out over the Palisades and the rooftop is every bit as amazing as he described The apartment comfortably fitted myself my small child and my parents It was wonderful to be able to cook at home and relax in the living room Washington Heights is a family friendly quiet suburb with all modern conveniences close by The train into the city was easy to catch and did not take as long as I had expected I would love to stay here again'
p2
S'Stayed in Ted s place to attend a friend s wedding in the neighborhood Three other friends also stayed in nearby airbnb spots and by comparing notes we decided that Ted s place is by far the best although the others were just fine as well The place is just as described and Ted was a really flexible host meeting us early to let us drop our stuff off The view from the roof is truly fantastic and Ted was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine to enjoy The apartment easily accommodated four The neighborhood is great and it s a super easy ride on the A train downtown Highly recommend I d definitely stay there again'
p3
S'Ted s apartment is a hidden gem in Washington Heights Comfortable cozy full of light it really makes you feel at home Ted Tasha are wonderful hosts they even left us a bottle of Italian wine for us to enjoy The flat is a couple blocks away from the A train subway and from the M4 bus that takes you all the way to Midtown Lots of restaurants in the surroundings the area is known for its good food and the Cloisters museum in Bryant park just a short walk away It was a really good experience for us it feels good to have felt home away from home A big thanks to Ted Tasha'
p4
S'We had a great time at this apartment Ted and Tasha were great hosts very accommodating and responsive The place was great with a lot of room It was a good enough distance away to feel like you have some space from the big city but can easily get there by subway The roof was beautiful as was the place Book it you won t be sorry'
p5
S'Ted provided excellent instructions on how to get from airport to the apartment and how to use local transportation It was very easy to get to the city and Uber riders were convenient The listing description was very accurate and the neighborhood is a hidden gem with wonderful restaurants parks and activities The location was ideal for our needs We weren t in the apartment very much but when we were there we spent most of our time relaxing on the rooftop with nice breezes and incredible views of the city and a full moon'
p6
S'Ted s place is lovely It s a sizable apartment with a comfy couch and master bed The Hudson views were also quite beautiful and very peaceful We greatly enjoyed the space and the neighborhood There s easy access to the A train restaurants and a cute little park just a couple blocks away There was a mix up with the key when we arrived but Ted was on top of it very communicative and it was sorted out in a matter of moments Also worth mentioning the door men were very welcoming and helpful during our stay Go to Ted s A'
p7
S'Ted was an amazing host Upon arrival there was a small mix up with the key Ted was on the phone in seconds and had everything worked out within a minute He was super nice He seemed genuinely concerned that our young group of Midwestern travelers safely navigated NYC and actually texted us twice to make sure all was well How thoughtful The apartment is super close to the subway and it is tucked away in a super cute neighborhood The shower is super cool and the beds are very comfy Most importantly we all felt very safe in the building Fabulous apartment and fabulous host I would certainly recommend booking with Ted on your next trip to NYC'
p8
S'Ted was an excellent host checking in to see if we got in to apt OK and responsive with questions almost immediately Key pick up was very easy Place was as described with great location close to Hudson River Waterfront Greenway Ft Tryon Park and easy access to subway Apt was clean and cozy Also highly recommend if you are traveling with infant Crib was very handy'
p9
S'We spent a bit more than a week in Ted s place and had a wonderful time The apartment is filled with light and has a great view of the Hudson The bed was wonderfully comfortable and we had everything we needed The neighborhood is lovely and quiet and a convenient 20 30 minutes from midtown on the subway While we did not meet Ted in person handover of the keys went smoothly and Ted was in touch regularly by email to check on how things were going We are hoping to arrange a return visit'
p10
S'Ted s apartment was just as he described it and perfect for us It is in a classic building complex with gorgeous river views and the roof view is 360 degrees of breathtaking We visited our nearby daughter and easily took the subway to the Upper West Side to dine Apartment itself is very luxurious and comfortable Beautifully appointed and the host made us feel very welcome The extensive library mimicked our own and if only we could have had the time to sit on the roof and read We would gladly return'
p11
S'The neighborhood was lovely close to the subway and in a very nice area We had spent much time trying to get as close to our friends as possible and managed with this just two blocks away The view of the roof top is incredible Our experience at the actual apartment was very disappointing The kitchen was covered in cockroaches which only came out at night and left my heart standing still We traveled with a 3 year old and 11 month old baby and this left the experience traumatizing for me so much so that we left with all our things in the middle of the night When we got there the apartment was not ready although flight details were shared in very first communication with host We had to search for own towels and make up the beds searching for bedding The baby cot was used as storage unit with stroller and papers in it It took me a while to recover from the disappointment and then we finally went out exploring This was our first family holiday since 2014 When we returned we found the host had been at the apartment to come and clean up there was rotten fruit in the garbage and dirt hairballs everywhere as well The next morning the host arrived at the apartment to collect some things This was just awful and our privacy felt very much invaded So overall I would not recommend this specific apartment to anyone'
p12
S'Ted was a great host The place was exactly as described The apartment had a beautiful view of the Hudson River from the living room and building was very quiet My family had a wonderful long weekend and took in all the neighborhood had to enjoy Lots of great parks for young kids good restaurants and markets super close The rooftop terrace was the best part'
p13
S'Very Cody apartment in good quiet neighborhood Stayed there for 4 nights with my family 2 kids 1 3 Felt immediately at home Great 360 view from roof terrace Train stations are near by so that you reach Time Square and Central Park within 30 Minutes Would gladly come again and can recommend it'
p14
S'This is a beautiful and comfortable apartment in a gorgeous part of upper Manhattan by the Hudson River Ted welcomed us at the location and filled us in on the particulars A short walk to the subway the Starbucks several great eateries groceries and of course the wine store The local parks are wonderful The view from the property along the river is fabulous We would stay here again in a heartbeat'
p15
S'If you re visiting NYC for a few months or less this apartment is for you The location is incredible and the rooms beds are comfortable Though the apartment is on the smaller size the value is great The upshot of the small size is that the air conditioning units can cool the entire apartment in a matter of minutes during the summer The hosts couldn t have been friendlier If you like to sleep in after a long night out I would recommend bringing an eye mask as the blinds aren t the greatest'
p16
S'We absolutely loved our stay at Camila s The location could not be more perfect for exploring the city by foot or subway If you are looking to really live like a local and explore all the districts I cannot recommend this apartment enough Key handover was incredibly easy and Camila Brendan were fantastic with communication very quick to respond to any queries Thank you so much for everything'
p17
S'The apartment is clean comfortable and in a great location We slept very well on the beds and felt very much at home with great kitchen TV and internet We loved the hip and trendy neighborhood and did several of the nearby tours like the one at the tenement museum You can get everywhere downtown by walking bike share or public transport subway 1 block away Being close to Little Italy the Greenwich Village and Chinatown make it a restaurant lovers dream We will definitely stay here again for our next trip Thanks Camila'
p18
S'My stay at Richard and Wendy s was spectacular The room was perfect for me They have an AC unit but we decided to go with the cross ventilation from the bathroom and bedroom windows as well as the ceiling fan At times I was almost too chilly If at any time I wanted the AC unit in the window Richard said he would be happy to put it in but I preferred the breeze Their hospitality was wonderful I felt more like an old family friend They were very welcoming without being overbearing I adored their friendly yellow lab dog Roady I had a gate in my bedroom doorway to have privacy when I wanted it as well as a door of course They provided beautiful fresh seasonal fruit for breakfast I shared a shower with their son I only saw their son twice and we had no time conflicts for the shower Their home is lovely right next to a large park and a block from the A train They live in lovely quiet out of the way section of Washington Heights near Columbia and Presbyterian Hospital I have family in the area I plan the return to Richard and Wendy s next time I visit'
p19
S'We were in NYC for a week to spend time with our son and attend his graduation We were very fortunate to have found Jason Ondine s place on Staten Island It was convenient to our son s small apartment and within walking distance to the ferry A short bus and or taxi ride is also an option Jason and Ondine were terrific hosts who could not have been more accommodating They immediately made us feel welcome and comfortable starting with a glass of wine to help celebrate our son s special occasion Ondine invited me to accompany her to the grocery store to get whatever we might need for our stay And the following day she even contributed her graphic and artistic skills plus some materials to help me decorate my son s hat for the graduation ceremony something he didn t let me know about until the last minute yikes Since she works from home Ondine was available throughout our stay for questions directions and suggestions On a couple of occasions knowing our schedule was tight she even volunteered to give us a lift to the ferry or our son s apartment The 2nd floor apartment is in a 1920 s house located in an established historic quiet safe neighborhood It was clean and comfortable with plenty of windows for natural light The renovated kitchen had all the basics plus amenities that made our stay so easy The living den area has a sofa that can be used as a sleeper a futon a flat screen TV and the original hardwood floors covered with colorful rugs There s a comfortable bed ample closet space a refurbished bathroom with plenty of counter space hot water and towels To top it all off we were treated to fresh flowers throughout our stay This couple s hospitality could not have been better They made us feel very much at home from arrival to departure If the location and listing suits your needs we couldn t recommend it more highly Thanks Jason Ondine Hopefully we ll get to see you again'
p20
S'I enjoyed staying at Jason s and Ondine s apartment They are amazing hosts they are very nice and friendly people and did everything to make us feel comfortable Ondine was available during the day she gave us different recommendations and offered grocery store and ferry ride which was very nice Apartment is very clean and comfy with plenty of sunlight comfortable beds and good size kitchen dining area It has all the necessary supplies and cable Location is very convenient with 10 min walk or short bus ride to the ferry 40 min away from Manhattan We were also enjoying the weather and making frequent trips to the South beach which is 30 40 min bus ride 20 min car ride away I can definitely recommend Jason s and Ondine s place and I am going to use it in future if necessary'
p21
S'We had a very good time in Jason and Ondines Apartment It was a special experience to stay in a typical American country home build in the early 20th century A convinient stay far away from the citynoise It was great to take the ferry to Manhattan Spectacular views even at night It only took us 10 minutes to walk to the harbour and Ondine was always willing to give us a ride Both were very helpfull to give us any information about New York and their Staten Island neighbourhood We arrived a little hungry from a long journey from Holland in the evening and they walked us to some nice restaurants in the neighboorhood We chose for a very good pizza restaurant called Pier 17 Our first experience in a typical American restaurant with a very friendly waitress In the morning we had breakfast in their well equiped kitchen Afterwards we went off to explore the city and came back late in the evening We slept very well in the comfortable bedroom s A very good stay for a reasonable price'
p22
S'We have just returned from a wonderful four night stay in Jason and Ondine s apartment and had a great time We have stayed on Staten Island before but never this close to the ferry terminal The apartment was great and superbly equipped The attention to detail was fantastic with everything we could have wished for being in the apartment Ondine also bought us a plentiful supply of groceries which saved us having to dash out to the local store as soon as we got there We only managed a few chats with our hosts as this was a very short visit to attend a family wedding but got on great and would love to have stayed longer and got to know them even more Ondine even ran us down to the ferry terminal on the day of the wedding to save Karne walking too far in her heels We love Staten Island and when we get chance to come back will once again stay with these fantastic and attentive hosts It was a pleasure to meet you guys'
p23
S'Jason and Ondine were very welcoming and accommodating my booking was made with very short notice then extended an extra day The apartment was clean stocked and furnished thoughtfully The neighborhood was charming the ferry nearby and Ondine provided helpful recommendations from food to running paths I would absolutely stay again should my travels bring me back this way'
p24
S'We spent a week on Staten Island at the apartment It was exactly as described They were very kind and stayed up late to welcome us into the apartment and had got things in for our breakfast The place is great very clean spacious and comfortable Jason and his partner were extremely friendly welcoming and happy to help with anything They were all ways available either in person or online for any questions The neighbourhood seemed nice and friendly and it was a short 10 15 mins walk down to the Ferry We went to the city nearly every day and really enjoyed the ferry ride there and back much nicer than sitting in the underground We had a really great week and would for sure stay there again if we go back to NYC'
p25
S'Firstly I would just like to say What a beautiful home From the moment I saw the pictures I knew it was the place for me and my family Secondly the moment we arrived at the house we fell in love with it It had such an American feel to it The apartment itself was beautiful Every little detail made us feel right at home as soon as we got there Spacious and equipped with everything we needed Jason and Ondine were the perfect hosts Great to chat to and did so much for us It was a pleasure getting to know you both and we will certainly be back in the near future Thank you again for letting us in to your tremendous home Daniel Rebekah Sharon and Evelyn'

p28
S'We had a great time in this beautiful apartment It was lovely decorated warm and had everything you need even more Jason and Ondine are very welcoming friendly and they really care about their guests They give us a lot of informations about the neighbourhood and good tips to visit NYC It is one of the best place we have experienced with Airbnb and would really recommend it to everyone who wants to spend a good time in New York You will be traveling by the Ferry everyday 10 min walk from the appartment which is a so beautiful journey to start Every night you will have a lovely view of Manhattan when coming back home Thank you so much Jason and Ondine for being so kind and so thoughtful Once again we wish you a happy New Year 2016'

S'We had a god time in your house Marcantoni and becca make a lovelly atypical couple They are welcoming and helpful people They help us for during our trip and they have always give us good advices The room was comfortable and clean but missing perhaps cupboards My only regret is not being able to sell more with them because on my side my limited knowledge of English which settled a kind of distance'

p62
S'MarcAntoni and Becca are correct and discrete hosts The communication prior to our arrival was excellent They welcomed us in their cosy and very clean flat in Brooklyn on walking distance of subway line J which brings you directly to Manhattan e g Canal Street in Chinatown The room was light and the bed very comfortable If you come with more than two guests you can sleep on the sofa bed in the living room which is somewhat less comfortable but acceptable We had a nice stay in their appartment and can recommend them'

S'We had a great time at MarcAntonis and Beccas place The room was quiet to the backyard and there was everything we needed The connection to Manhattan were good 2 different lines very close There are some shops to buy food quite close and a supermarket at Kosciuszko St which we only found out after a few days because we used Gates station before They gave us good recommendations for restaurants and nice places in the neighborhood The place is good for a trip to NY and also to explore Brooklyn which has many great places too'
p65
S'MarcAntoni and his wife were amazing hosts They weren t there once we arrived but they communicated to us beforehand where we could find their key and to make ourselves comfortable Once meeting they made us feel right at home and asked about our days gave us suggestions on places to go yummy and free and even had a binder filled with even more suggestions of places to check out The room was neat and clean looks just like the picture the cat wasn t a bother at all I like cats anyway but just in case you don t you won t even notice she s there and they had extra towels soap lotion toothpaste etcetc To meet any of those dang I forgot this at home needs I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend this place to anyone Also transportation was so easy to get around from here Plus MarcAntoni offered us a ride to the airport that was cheaper than any Uber or Lyft making the stress of getting to the airport on time a nonexistent issue STAY HERE It was beautiful and so were they'
p66
S'We spent almost a week with MarcAntoni and Becca and had a great time at their Brooklyn home The apartment was as nice as pictured and conveniently located between two subway lines which both easily get you to Manhattan Hosts were very welcoming helpful and easygoing Thank you guys for sharing your home with us Vitaly Katya'

p69
S'MarcAntoni and Becca were amazing hosts although we didn t see each other that often they were very communicative and quick to respond to any questions Their place is located not too far from the big city and a perfect location for traveling to and from Brooklyn Manhattan Queens and Cony Island The place itself is clean cozy and again a good location for those willing to explore NY Their cat Ebony is also one of the most loving and affectionate cats which was definitely a plus'
p70
S'Spacious room as described Nice and clean apartment Great host who have been very helpful and always ready to answer our questions A few minutes walking to two subway lines who will take you directly to Manhatan They have a guide with useful tourist information We recomend this place and for sure would stay there again'
p71
S'We would highly recommend staying here and would definitely return MarcAntoni and Becca were great hosts and really opened their home to us and made us feel right at home staying with them The room and shared spaces were all very clean tidy and comfortable and as they appear in the listing The apartment is in a quiet residential neighbourhood and about a 8 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station to take you straight into Manhattan or link you to any other destination in the city Thank you both for being such wonderful hosts and for such a great stay We hope to stay with you again sometime very soon'
p72
S'We had a great time living with MarcAntony and Becca They are super friendly and welcoming we felt as if we were at home Their apartment is close to subway supermarket coffee shop bar everything you need while traveling If you want to move around Brooklyn this place is convenient going to Manhattan takes around 40min NY public transport is not friendly is slow and inefficient I would definitely stay with them again'
p73
S'MarcAntoni and Becca are wonderful people and fantastic hosts You will feel right at home in their beautiful warm and cozy apartment There is plenty of space in the bedroom nice bed and everything is very clean I cant think of anything they wouldn t have if you are in need Great people Cant go wrong staying here'
p74
S'Dimitry was a wonderful host He was in communication with me from the start answering all questions quickly He was there when we arrived He helped me find great parking directed us to the grocery store and subway and made us all feel welcome The apartment is convenient to the subway and the beach Brighton 6 is a nice walk to get back and forth The cost savings was well worth the 30 minute subway ride Apartment was clean and comfortable I look forward to staying here again'
p75
S'The neighborhood was safe and the apartment was exactly as pictured It was well kept and clean Dimitry was very nice and gave us tips on what to see in the city and advice on getting around town We did request he pick us up from airport which was a great call Our overall experience was great'
p76
S'The apt is exactly which showed in the picture The neighborhood is safe the only thing is you have to find the parking during the night if you decide to come here by car On the other hand subway just few blocks away which is easy to catch up and go into Manhattan inside NYC Everything was perfect you have your own place totally feel like home We had extra blankets and small bed too due to one of my girl doesn t feel comfortable to share bed House is pretty clean and we have 1 bathroom and 1 restroom which are perfect for a group of 4 Highly recommend to stay here safe and save a lot of money for a group'
p77
S'The apartment was immaculate So hard to find such a spacious home away from home in Brooklyn The walk to the subway was easy and safe and the direct trains to Manhattan were a breeze to use Dimitry was a wonderful host meeting us at the apartment when we arrived and available by phone text whenever we had a question You will definitely NOT regret booking this apartment for your visit to the city'
p78
S'We stayed for seven nights at Dimitry s apartment in Brooklyn The apartment was very nice comfortable and even big enough for six people Dimitry provided us with everything we needed including towels and blankets for everyone Most time we travelled by subway to Manhattan and the subway station is in a reachable distance I can highly recommend this apartment for single and larger parties who want to discover NYC Not just because the cost benefit ratio is fair but also due to Dimitry who is a great host Thank you'
p79
S'We had a fantastic stay at Dimitry s house There was plenty of space and it was very clean We felt safe in the neighborhood at all times the only problem we faced in the neighborhood itself was that most of the businesses only accept cash so make sure you have plenty with you The house was a good 1 5 hour subway ride from Time Square but the beach was only a few blocks away and it was very beautiful The subway is also a few blocks away from the house and the B Q trains are available which will take you right into Manhattan Dimitry was a fantastic host and even picked us up dropped us off at the airport for a very reasonable additional fee Overall we had a great experience and would definitely stay with Dimitry again'
p80
S'This was our second stay at Dimitry s place in Brighton Beach We are a family of 5 and we love it Expect a modernized apartment in an old building in a funky beach neighborhood with the feel of old Brooklyn The subway is close Manhattan is a bit far but not bad on the express and Coney Island is 15 minutes away'
p81
S'We had a great stay at Dimitry s place It was a very convenient location for the things that we wanted to do He was always very responsive and quick to help when needed There was a small coffee pot and some tea left for us Check in and check out was easy The king bed was very comfortable and warm and there was even a pack and play for our baby He had some soap and 1 1 2 baths which was nice There are so many great Turkish and Russian restaurants nearby to try It takes about eight minutes to walk to the metro so that was nice too Our favorite places were Wise Espresso Bar on Coney Island Road and Beyti Kebab on Brighton Beach Road It is a less than 15 minute walk to the beach We would stay here again'
p82
S'Our stay at Dimitry s place was great He was an amazing host and his apartment was great He was able to pick us up from the airport also he was quick to reply to questions we had for him He also referred us to places we should visit while in New York His apartment felt like I was just at home because he has made sure his apartment feels warm and welcoming This has been my second time staying at Dimitry s I enjoyed my stay here this time as much as the last and I would definitely continue to try and stay at Dimitry s next time I go to New York'
p83
S'Anthony s place was perfect for our three day stay in NYC The subway stations are roughly 0 5 miles from his location making it easy to get into the city His apartment was very hip and clean it also had everything we could have needed for our stay including a lovely garden Anthony checked in on us several times even though he was out of the country and his friend who gave us our keys was incredibly sweet and even waited up late when we were stuck in traffic Would highly recommend'
p84
S'I didn t have the pleasure of meeting Javier but he was quick to respond to any messages I sent him The day before we left on our trip he sent me a lot of information on the area how to get around and even hospital information Even while we were traveling he sent a text wondering how the trip was going and seeing if we had any questions When we arrived at the apartment we were surprised at how big it is The pictures don t really do it justice There are actually 2 bedrooms one with the king bed and one with the bunks Very comfortable accommodations Javier left an envelope with some menus from local restaurants and we were able to take advantage of that He warned us ahead of time that the garage was a tight fit We were in a midsize car and didn t have any problems but if you have a large vehicle it could be a problem Quite a few subway stops within 10 minutes walk so we were able to get anywhere in the city that we wanted to with no problems He also recommended an app for navigating around town that worked great This is someplace I would definitely return to if I ever visit the city again and would highly recommend it'
p85
S'The room was good the apartment was nice the roomies were nice too I didn t see them a lot because I only slept there But when I saw them always friendly If there are any missunderstandings no problem Alexandra was very nice The area isn t perfect but I survived as a blonde girl D I would book again'
p86
S'the place was fair Alexandra gave us an extra single mattress cuz my friend and I were too big to fit in the couch the neighborhood wasn t too bad it seemed to be safe there is a subway station 4 blocks from the apartment I barely saw Alexandra but when we talked she was kind and friendly'
p87
S'The room is basic but clean and I would recommend it for a short stay The apartment is located very close to a subway that has express trains that will take you downtown very quickly I wouldn t recommend the room for longer stays the futon is very uncomfortable to sleep on for long periods of time and the room is very noisy or at least it was when I visited making sleeping difficult Alexa is a lovely host and a very nice person She ll happily give you recommendations and help finding your way around Her flatmate was very quiet and not interested in hosting she didn t bother to learn my name or engage with me at all When I saw her she didn t tell me that that the bathroom was going to be renovated later that day rendering it out of action for a day or so which would have been helpful to know Overall this is great value for money for a short stay'
p88
S'I have stayed here for a week in April 2014 It is a simple room with basic facilities I would recommend it so Neighborhood is safe with a supermarket a subway station and a laundromat around SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN are silent and sympathetic If you are planning a trip in Manhattan I would suggest you to consider this place'
p89
S'Alex was great I reached out to her in the late afternoon and she confirmed my stay in a few hours for later on that evening The room and everything else was exactly as advertised and she provided a separate futon instead of the couch because I was so tall Easy access to the 1 and A line s as well able to make it to the heart of the downtown core in 30 minutes Would definitely stay again'
p90
S'Good location Close to a subway station Clean and cozy Some nights were louder than the others due to neighbours but overall it was a great stay for the price I d recommend this place if you re spending most of your time outside and just need a place to store your stuff sleep Alexandra and her roommate were very friendly and nice'
p91
S'I stayed with Alex and Jane for a month Their both very sweet people Alex makes it easy to talk about your stay and both Alex and Jane are very helpful with general questions like fare shops and so forth The A express is right around the corner and will get you to Manhattan by day in 20 minutes but the trip to Brooklyn is far mostly around an hour The neighborhood is all latino and pretty cheap The bed is not so bad as other have written but the room does not have air condition which is a big minus Some nights it got to hot for me to sleep and I would talk a walk to cool down'
p92
S'Alex left early from her work to receive me at 1 30am on a friday night The appartment is clean and very nice The bed is not the most comfortable to sleep in but it s fine if you are just staying for a few nights By metro 5 minutes walk from appartment it takes about 30mins to get to downtown Manhattan The appartment has a great value for a low price'
p93
S'Let s start with the good points first Alexandra was in time we could reach her She also gave us fresh laundered and clean sheets The room has a good size though good space for clothes and luggage Now the negative points The appartement was not clean Neither the bathroom nor the kitchen In the bathroom were hairs and the toilett looked like it hadn t been cleaned for a while The floor and the carpets in there were really unclean The kitchen was also not clean There was dirty washing up in the sink most of the time the oven was full with dried liquits from cooking Noodlewater etc The last point the couch where guests have to sleep on was horrible my back still hurts All in all it was not worth the money there are much better alternatives I don t get why people rent rooms in appartements like this and want to get money for it I m not choosy but when you want to get money do something for it A little more cleanness and hygienics should be the standart and is not too much to ask for'
p94
S'My bus was late and Alexa missed her class to give me the keys The room is perfect for a short stay spacious enough quiet and very clean sheets I talked with Alexa for a little bit when I was about to leave and it was a very nice conversation I wish we talked more In all I would recommend the room'
p95
S'Alexandra was a very nice host friendly and easy going I appreciated that she was as flexible as she could be with scheduling check in out The room was very clean and a good size for one person or two people for what I needed a safe clean room to rent for a few days Close to transportation and neighborhood was safe Would stay again'
p96
S'The stay in New York was really nice We arrived late in the evening but Alexa was waiting and handing us over the key She gave us helpful instructions how to get to the apartment and Answered every question we had We had a great time and the subway was also so close that it was absolutely no problem to get to the city and also home late nights'
p97
S'Alexa s apartment was perfect for a long or short stay in the city With a subway station just around the corner takes about 10 15 mins to Times Square Plenty of supermarkets and places to eat in her safe neighbourhood too Alexa met me at her apartment on arrival and will give friendly advice about the city The room is spacious for 2 people and nice and warm Could come and go as I pleased although I didn t see much of Alexa and her flat mate they made me feel very comfortable and welcome at their home Would stay here again if I m back in the city Thanks again Ash x'
p98
S'I am from Nepal and this was my first time travel to america and i tried hostel hotels Airnb offers some time friends couch all etc life is an experience specially in america accommodations are very expensive and have to look all these options found this nice welcoming and friendly host and my stay was great she opened the door on time and replied all emails on time'
p99
S'Alexandra was very quick to respond to emails and texts before I got to the city and when I got in The studio is quaint with a futon closet chair and end table A foam pad for the bed is good for one person but two would be cramped on the futon Bathroom is down the hall has a bath shower commode small sink The neighborhood is lively and can be noisy until very late on the weekend but for the most part everyone kept to themselves on the street and never once did I feel unsafe Short walk 5 or so minutes from the A and C trains which makes getting in and out of Manhattan a breeze Its not the most elegant of places it has definite signs of age but if you just need a bed to go back to after a long day of NYC life this fits the bill I d come back to stay if Alex would have me'
p100
S'Alexandra was very gentle answered all my questions before and during my trip in NYC and was there to welcome us when we arrived the first day The room was spacious for my friend and me The bed futon was correct The subway station is very near and it takes max 20 min to go to Times Square I highly recommend Alexandra s place'
p101
S'Alexandra was very sweet and helpful with my arrival and during my stay The room is a decent size but very basic however I found the fold out couch with additional mattress comfortable enough and only intended to use the room as a sleeping place at the end of two long days The bathroom and kitchen were quite small and cluttered and not particularly clean This place is fine for a cheap place to stay on Manhattan however note that although it is very close to a subway station it is at least 20 minutes by train from most attractions and quite a long way from the airports'
p102
S'I spend roughly three month at Alex s place as I was offered an internship in New York from July to October Alexandra is very kind and helpful and you get a lot of privacy in this apartment I only bumped in to the other roommate once Compared to other places this is a very cheap option needless to say it is therefore not a luxurious place The area seems safe people in the street may try to get in contact with you especially the guys if you re a girl but they are harmless and actually quite nice if you get to know them One of the tough looking guys even helped me to the subway with my luggage the day I left The subway is very close to the apartment and as you can catch the A express you can get downtown in 16 20 minutes Overall I was happy with my stay and I would recommend it to anyone who s looking for an affordable place in New York with a lot of privacy who s not a neatfreak'
p103
S'The listing description and photos are accurate I briefly met Alexandra when I checked in but we kept in contact throughout my whole stay She was very flexible nice and accommodating She even provided a small area heather which came in handy for a night that got a bit chilly The area is safe I walked really late at night and nothing ever happened There is a subway station nearby that takes you anywhere in Manhattan Although the apt is located uptown you have the benefit of being in Manhattan which means that subway service is usually not interrupted during weekends something that happens regularly with trains going to Brooklyn Queens I would recommend this place to anyone'
p104
S'The room could ve used some vacuuming and dusting I also tried to get the bed to fit for two but it wasn t working There was a weird loud banging noise coming from the pipes outside the window which made it little hard to sleep at night But overall it was a fine place to spend few nights and Alexandra was a very nice and helpful host'
p105
S'Alexandra was great I didn t get to meet her but she was very accessible and welcoming The apartment was clean and quiet I found the room to be quite spacious Thanks for the wifi The apartment is really accessible to public transportation I would definitely stay here again next time I m in NYC'
p106
S'Hi Everyone I really enjoyed my stay with Carol She is warm kind smart and very professional Her space is cozy very clean and a great location I slept wonderful and I m grateful to Carol for her hospitality and generosity with information and making me feel very at home in such a big city I can t say enough that it s just a great place to stay Even down to a wonderful great cup of coffee in the mornig I plan on going back and look forward to telling my friends about Carol and her place'
p107
S'Carol was most gracious and was an excellent hostess on my first trip to New York Despite the fact that I rolled into NYC with almost zero knowledge of the city she pointed me in the right direction The room where I stayed was clean stylish and boasts a private bathroom within the bedroom The apartment is conveniently located within walking distance to the subway stations and to the sights of Central Park Despite the bustle of the city it was truly an excellent place to call my home away from home An oasis within the midst of the concrete jungle All in all I couldn t have had a better experience'
p108
S'This place was great and Carol was awesome The location is perfect just like she said in her description I arrvied at 11 30 on a week night and Carol could not have been more welcoming or nicer even though she had to get up early the next day for work This is a great place and I am sure I ll stay there again'
p109
S'Carol was a really nice host she was available and she answered to all my questions about the city The appartment was clean and together with the bedroom I had my own bathroom which was much appreciated The appartement is close to everything 2 different lines of subway Central Park for the runners its great a lot of restaurants in the area so I really enjoyed my holidays in New York This place is precious and I keep in mind for my next trip to NY I highly recommend it'
p110
S'I was in NYC on a business trip and I had the best stay at Carol s It was my first time with Airbnb but she helped delete every doubt of mine She replies messages very quickly the room is big full of natural light and features a private bathroom The entire apartment and the building are both nice and extremely well located in the lively UWS Carol made sure I always had my huge morning coffee A stunt to me Highly recommended'
p111
S'The room has a sofa bed and not a real mattress but the room is large and you get your own private bathroom two great luxuries in New York Carol is great attentive hostess She takes care of her guests and I had zero issues The apartment is in a fabulous location on upper west side lots of shops and restaurants Close to central park and the subway Highly recommended'
p112
S'Carol is a great host Really nice flexible and helpful She gave me the keys even before the time we had agreed just to help me The place is great as well Excellent location just one block from subway and Central Park Close to many restaurants grocerys and everything you need The room is clean full of light with everything you need to be comfortable Could ask for a better place I would definitely rent her place if I come to NY again'
p113
S'Carol s pics of her apartment give no justice to the beautiful place she has The guest room is spacious luminous and with a totally private neat and cozy bathroom The location of the apartment is great one block from the metro and Central park 10 min walk or less from the Natural history museum The building has an elevator very convenient if you have big luggage For breakfast there are super cute places at walking distance that you can t miss Also I went back after 9pm one night and the neighbor looks very safe Carol accepted my request of checking in early very early and I really loved she was up waiting for me at 8 30am with a cup of hot coffee So I could drop off my luggage at her place before hitting the city She is a very pleasant and friendly person and I enjoyed her conversation a lot I feel like I made a new friend in NY Thanks again for the lovely staying I hope to be able to get back there soon'
p114
S'This was my second stay at Carol s beautiful apartment and my experience was just as good as the first time Carol is a gracious and accommodating hostess patiently putting up with my unpredictable schedule The bed is comfortable the building is quiet the private bathroom is a nice luxury and the location is fantastic My only disappointment this time was in not having any time to visit with Carol who is very enjoyable to talk with'
p115
S'Carols apartment was in the perfect location to discover everything the upper west side in NYC has to offer The apartment was within walking distance to Central Park the Met Levain s Bakery Barney s Greengrocer and the list goes on Carol was a warm and friendly host who was very kind to accommodate allowing me to check in early which helped me out so much She gave me some great recommendations on food and places to visit and made me feel very welcome in her apartment The room was spacious clean comfortable and the private bathroom was the best a luxury in NYC There was also a lift in her apartment building which made it easier for luggage and was always accessible and rarely being used often by other residents which was great My stay at Carol s apartment was better value than any hotel on the UWS and I would definitely stay here again next time I am in town'
p116
S'Everything about my stay was great Carol is really nice her apartment is beautiful and very clean especially the bathroom The bedroom I had was large quiet private and the plus of having my own bathroom was key The shower was really terrific great water pressure I slept on a pull out couch that was very comfortable spacious and woke up rested each morning The apartment is close to the park subway shops restaurants its ideal I made a new friend with Carol and am already planning my next stay at her apartment She greated me made sure I had what I needed and really was a wonderful host'
p117
S'Carol was a gracious and friendly host Her apartment is spacious and airy The guest room is quiet comfortable and quite large especially for NYC Having a private bath is a real plus The Upper West Side location is convenient to transportation and Central Park I was very happy to find her as a host'

S'Carol made me feel very welcome she was relaxed and I could ask her anything about the area or NY in general The apartment was a really good size clean and quiet and in such a great area near Central Park the museums cafes supermarkets bars and restaurants I was traveling alone for the most part of the holiday so this was a perfect location and neighbourhood The metro stop is really near and bus stop across the park and downtown It was just a really easy going and relaxing stay and when I return I shall come back to stay with Carol'
p120
S'I want to thank Carol for her hospitality She is a friendly host and very welcoming Her apartment is located in a very nice location close to the subway bus and especially to Central Park The guest room is very quiet and has all the comforts you could want private bath air conditioning and TV I highly recommend it Lidia from Italy'
p121
S'I was on business in New York for 10 days and had a very pleasant stay in Carol s apartment Carol is friendly and helpful and although I didn t spend much time in her apartment it did feel like a home away from home after a long day s work and very much worth the commute from down town The neighborhood is quiet sophisticated and leafy I above enjoyed being able to walk in central park early in the morning which is just a block away And Carol recommended me one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever eaten at not even expensive just a few steps away So 10 out 10 for Carol and her apartment'
p122
S'Carol is in short a wonderful considerate and hospitable host She replied quickly to my request and made me feel very welcome from the minute I arrived Throughout my stay she would check in with me always making sure that everything was ok The room is spacious bright and very clean as is the private bathroom which is a great plus You very much have you own personal space and Carol will Her apartment is in a beautiful and safe area with loads of shops and restaurants near by and of course Central Park and all the museums on Upper East Side There are several subway lines 5 min away you couldn t be in a better area with all the locals and away from all the turists Carol s place is in short great value for money which is primarily because she is an amazing host with a spacious and clean room in a great location Thanks Carol I ll be back'

S'Apt Joy s apt is a true 2 2 with a large terrace off the second bedroom It is a 6th floor penthouse suite in a prewar walk up The six flights were easy to handle in the fall and we enjoyed the exercise It is a good value for a true 2 2 The kitchen is small but sufficiently stocked The common area seems slightly smaller than the photos and the top bedroom seems slightly larger than the photos The apt is on the side of the building so there is minimal street noise Location Great location It is centrally located in the UWS 7 minutes to Central park and 1 min to the subway Communication Joy s communication is excellent She is flexible and kind Appointments The house has all necessary appointments for a stay in nyc Cleanliness The cleanliness of the house was not up to par I am not sure of the cause of this as everything else was great but we informed Joy and she noted that she will be addressing this issue with her managing staff'

S'The apartment was in a very convenient location had great facilities and plenty of space Definitely need to be fit to stay here with 81 stairs up to the apartment A great positive was being able to access the wifi network to keep in touch with home Unfortunately our 2nd set of keys were not working which was limiting however I think Joy and Lauren are trying to fix this for the next visitors We had a lovely stay Thank you Joy'
p197
S'I would rent this apartment again The location is excellent although nearer to Broadway than Central Park West the space is comfortable the two bedrooms are on separate floors which is nice there is a spacious balcony on the top floor and the apartment is kept very clean Two things to bear in mind there s a bit of a walk between where one picks up the key and the apartment and it s a five floor walk up 81 steps but who was counting so if one has heavy luggage go easy'
p198
S'I live in NYC and booked Joy Kerry s apartment for visiting family members Joy Kerry was very responsive to our questions and concerns prior to and during the trip It was very easy to pick up and drop off the key The apartment is beautiful clean and in a great location Be aware that it is a penthouse apartment on the top floor of a walkup so it is about six flights up My family didn t mind the walk and this beautiful apartment is worth it'

p202
S'Joy s apartment is exactly as pictured great location and perfect for 2 couples with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms Unfortunately there was some confusion about the doorman refusing to hand over the keys as arranged but eventually he did so and then the apartment hadn t been cleaned when we arrived because the cleaning lady had trouble getting in However Joy s contact Lauren was very helpful and once things were sorted everything was perfect Yes there are a few stairs but you get used to them Being so close to Central Park is a real bonus and also having the rooftop terrace if you enjoy some fresh air is great Would totally recommend the apartment Thanks Joy'
p203
S'Joy s place is fantastic the place is clean in a great location and really comfortable Unfortunately I did have a few troubles while I was there I had informed Joy that I would be checking in and checking out early but I was surprised to come back from grabbing coffee on my way out to have her friend in the place before 8 30am I think a bit of warning on that would have been helpful Also when I went to drop off the keys with the doorman at a different building the doorman was really upset with me leaving the keys there and almost refused to take them Lastly the hot water did not work at all on the last morning It did not even turn on Yet even with the mishaps I really did enjoy the place'

S'Joy was very friendly and very quick in terms of responding to emails so that was great The apartment was immaculately clean upon arrival and felt bigger than the pictures make it look The area is wonderful very well located in terms of restaurants the subway and central park The bedding and towels were all clean and of a very high standard You get used to the six flights of stairs pretty soon and my parents had a great stay'
p205
S'Wonderful airy apt But it is 6 floor walk up So do keep this in mind when packing I enjoyed my stay because the apt is quiet and peaceful by NYC standards Very comfy URL HIDDEN key pick up and drop off is not complicated but it is a few blocks away Good location with lots of cafes and restaurants and easy walk across the park to museums or down to Lincoln Center'
p206
S'This was a lovely penthouse apartment and we enjoyed our stay It is spacious quiet comfortably furnished reasonably priced and in a wonderful location Joy was quick to reply to my initial query and while we didn t meet she was OUS during my stay I got the sense that she s a warm person who values her friends and family from photos and decorations throughout the apartment This made the apartment even more comfortable As others have noted there is a 6 floor walk up no elevator and you may have to jiggle the keys a bit in their respective locks to get into the apartment But once inside it was a delight to stay in Joy s place'
p207
S'It could not have been more perfect It was well worth the 6 flights of stairs to get to these lovely accommodations The location is excellent neighbourhood safe great places to eat just outside the door and it was very quiet The space is exactly as described and very cozy and welcoming I highly recommend staying at Joy s penthouse it was delightful The neighbour even popped his head out his door when we heard us arriving and made sure we could get in the door without any problem He guessed we were Airbnb and recommended a good place to eat It was a lovely welcome'
p208
S'Everything has been perfect and as expected Key pick up drop off was easy The location is just perfect and in a nice neighborhood The apartment was tastefully decorated and very functional with a lot of space We had a three day illusion to really be living in New York Thank you'
p209
S'It was a joy to stay at Joy s Picking up dropping off the key was easy and convenient We also appreciated having a more flexible check out time too When staying there it was as if we were in the home of a friend or family member cozy and familiar The neighborhood is quiet and pretty there s a decent grocery store down the block a 24 hour CVS around the corner a 10 minute walk to subways and Central Park 2 blocks away The beds were super comfortable after spending our days nights out We ll definitely stay there again when we have an opportunity to return and would recommend it to our friends as a staycation The kitchen is very compact and lacks a microwave But with some creativity it would be very doable to prepare cook meals Pack light and prepare to hike up 5 flights of stairs It s worth it for 2B 2B and the rooftop patio'
p210
S'We enjoyed our stay in Joy s apt As noted it is up six flights of stairs so just be prepared for that We adapted and felt some satisfaction with that added burst of exercise at the end of each trip back to the apt The neighborhood is great to explore with lots of wonderful local spots for whatever it is you re seeking An added bonus for me was the highest rated shoe repair in Manhattan was just across the street literally and in two hours he repaired the heels that I d worn down from all of our walking The kitchen doesn t lend itself to much activity and there was a fair amount of late night noise from the neighbors a couple of times but it s life in the city Joy was very communicative and responsive'
p211
S'The apartment is nice clean welcoming The beds are really comfortable good mattresses and good pillows Nice lights nice pieces of furniture Kitchen fully equipped there is no microwave but you can use the oven The view from the upstairs bedroom is fantastic from one window you can see the top of Chrysler Building There are 5 floors to walk but we climbed them with pleasure every day and regarding the luggages after all the suitcases were empty when we arrived and brought them upstairs and really heavy only when we went back home In the surroundings you can find everything you need lots of supermarkets Zabars good restaurants The subway is a two minutes walk away Joy is really kind and helpful so I totally recommend this solution'
p212
S'Joy s apartment is a gem A duplex nestled above the roofs of the roofs of the upper West side it is clean comfortable and tasteful Joy made sure that there were clean bed and bath linens and left clear instructions about about the apartment as well as a smattering of guides to NYC and nearby restaurants which were useful We came down during an arctic weekend in February and the apartment became a real refuge from the constant bustle of New York as well as the freezing wind tunnels which affected each of our excursions around the city I ll definitely consider using this as a base for future trips to the city'
p213
S'We had a great Time at this Place Joy gave us upfront detailed instructions as she was not there at our arrival and everything was perfectly as described The Apartment is very clean warmly decorated and in perfect Location Coffee 24h cvs foodmarket subway everything less than 5 minutes walk from there In the night it is a quiet place The stairs were no problem and a good motivation for packing light We would love to stay here again if we return to NYC'
p214
S'Joy s apartment was lovely beyond description We came to NYC for a weekend getaway and the location couldn t have been more perfect It was secluded private yet in the middle of a metropolis at the centre of the world Her balcony has incredible views the bed was comfortable the apartment warm we visited in winter and it was just perfect Highly recommended'
p215
S'Fabulous What a little gem This cosy and homely little flat had everything we needed for our 5 night stay My friend is blind so we needed to stay somewhere easy for him to navigate alone ie no stairs that just appear in the middle of a floor The location was great we walked home late most nights and didn t feel worried about safety at all The street was quiet and felt a world away from the chaos of midtown My bed was really comfy and the bathrooms were small but perfectly formed with lots of very hot water The kitchen is tiny but great for breakfast and snacks and we were able to buy things from a nearby deli to eat in one night before the basketball The use of the Wi Fi was great too It s a 50 minute walk to Intrepid and an hour to Times Square the transport links were close but we chose to walk to most places I d love to stay again if I ever return to NYC Thanks for allowing us to stay in your home'
p216
S'Joy s Place was just like the photos showed plus the extra rooftop It was clean and charming We also didn t mind the set of stairs to get to the apartment What might be getting used to is that one can hear the neighbors talk and walk up the stairs but that s New York City for you Joy was great and quick in communicating directions for key pickup and other inquiries we had Overall the stay was lovely and I would definitely come back again Thank you Joy'
p217
S'Joy s apartment was amazing it is exactly as the pictures show Everything was perfect and easy picking up the keys locating the apartment and dropping them off at the end The location is perfect especially if you want to feel like a true New Yorker or love the Upper West Side neighborhood The beds were comfortable and all the amenities you could possibly ask for are at your finger tips Warning there are six flights of stairs you must climb but after a few times it became second nature I will definitely stay here again during my next visit to New York Joy was a pleasure to email throughout the process she was timely friendly and clearly enjoys sharing her slice of NY with those who come to visit You wont find a better deal host or experience like what you ll get with Joy s apartment'
p218
S'It was a great pleasure to stay at Joy s apartment we felt very comfortable and at home in the clean beautiful and very quiet space having a kitchen was an extra bonus as was the outdoor rooftop We loved the neighborhood some good places to eat close by we liked Jakobs Pickles and French Roast both a stone s throw from the front door Easy access to the subway and proximity to Central Park made this a perfect location for us Joy was very helpful ahead of time answering questions about yoga classes and where to find organic foods Staying at Joy s penthouse made our trip to NY very memorable'
p219
S'The flat of Joy is the ideal place for the lovers of the city to live really live NY This part of Upper West is full of life close to restaurants with terrasses supermarkets gym club cinema and also a sunday flea mkt and of course Central Park You are also at 100 m of the n 1 subway line All that in a very nice decorated flat with a wonderful terrasse with a view of the the city I have seen Joy the last day she s a wonderfull person and very helpfull Before coming she gave me all informations about the flat the quarter and a lot of good adresses And she s ending her mails with the words love joy and peace How more welcomed could you be in NY Thank you Joy to share your joie de vivre and this wonderfull and peacefull place in UWS'
p220
S'3 of us stayed at Joy s place for 4 nights Joy was very responsive to all our queries which made planning easier The location in the Upper West Side is great with many restaurants and shops within walking distance Subway line is 5 minutes away It is a safe neighborhood and we were walking even past midnight It is a 2 level penthouse with 2 bathrooms The only thing to be aware of is that this is a walk up unit so you need to be able to walk up 5 flights of stairs each time The location is 15 minutes by foot to Central Park which we visited everyday'
p221
S'In the hustle bustle of NYC Joy s apartment is a sanctuary Just as the photos depict it is a beautiful tranquil place The location is ideal for those who want the convenience of easy access to downtown buses and subway as well as a lovely short stroll to delightful Central Park whilst enjoying a peaceful night s sleep There are plenty of shops cafes restaurants very close by in this wonderful Upper West Side locale Joy s apartment has all the conveniences you ll need including clothes washing and drying facilities within the building note that the machines in the basement are US 1 75 per wash dry and take 7 x quarters The rooftop terrace is such a bonus and a great place to enjoy a coffee or glass of wine Even though there s no elevator lift the 6 flights of stairs are a way to ensure you work off all the culinary delights of the day I had a wonderful stay at Joy s place and highly recommend it for anyone visiting New York Thank you Joy xx'
p222
S'We had a great stay Perfect NYC apartment in a great neighborhood lived like locals Two floors with two baths offered each of our own space The apartment is ideally suited on Upper West Side close to Central Park great shopping food stores restaurants and activities in the immediate area Highly recommended'
p223
S'Fabulous gorgeous clean NYC apartment in upper west side Close to good restaurants LOVED Mermaid Inn restaurant for seafood A couple of things to note about the apartment it is on the 6th floor of a building with no elevator Pack light Also second bedroom has no door but is very private as it is upstairs from the main living area Overall the apartment is the perfect place to stay in New York City It is exactly as shown in photos was easy to check in and out of and perfectly equipped'
p224
S'My sister and I really enjoyed our stay at Joy s home We selected this place because of the great location and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood shops and restaurants The day we arrived a nice neighbor carried our suitcases upstairs which was a blessing Those 5 flights were a challenge at times An added bonus was meeting and chatting with Joy in person when she dropped in to pack for her next adventure'
p225
S'What an amazing time we had in NYC Joy was a delight to connect with She was flexible and quick to answer any requests or questions we had Her beautiful apartment was just as described It was clean spacious and met all of our needs perfectly The large terrace was an added bonus At the end of the day it was a welcoming retreat to lounge and relax and put our feet up especially after running the NYC Marathon With exercise in mind be aware that the apartment is located on the 6th floor of the building with no elevator so this provides a good workout You may consider packing light The location could not have been more convenient It is on the Upper West Side with lots of great restaurants and coffee Joe s around the corner was our favorite the magnificent Central Park as well as the subway close by The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and we most enjoyed living as locals rather than tourists We could not have chosen a better place to stay in NYC Any questions Just ask Joy She is so kind and eager to assist you'
p226
S'We had an amazing stay at Kerry s apartment It was just as pictured comfortable and bigger than I thought it would be We love the neighborhood Great restaurants Jacob s Pickles Kefi Cafe Lalo and really easy access to the subway I d recommend it to anyone heading to NYC'
p227
S'The apartment was lovely and spacious especially by NYC standards The rooftop terrace is a nice bonus I imagine it s extra awesome in the summer and spring months The neighborhood is great very family friendly and a short walk to Central park which we visited everyday The only real drawback is all the stairs you climb My friend and I are both marathon runners and we were struggling with our luggage As others have said pack light Also if you re hoping to cook meals there this may not be the place for you The kitchen is extremely tiny with no microwave Overall a great experience and would stay there again'
p228
S'We enjoyed Kerry s apartment throughly It was a great location close to the train and the awesome Jacob s Pickles and the delicious Baked my Melissa The stairs were always a laugh when the four of us came home It was a nice workout for our friend that just had triple bypass surgery this summer the apartment was as shown super comfortable great beds which are so important and the neighborhood was extremely quiet compared to other neighborhoods in NYC Great host great apartment awesome city'
p229
S'Joy s apartment was perfect for our stay My colleague and I needed to be in the city for a full week and it was such a retreat to have a roomy duplex for us to call home Communication with Joy and picking up the keys was easy as can be Great location to the subway and a beautiful neighborhood Its sprawling with great restaurants and has a wonderful vibe to it Know the 6 floor walkup is not for the light hearted Or for heels Thank you Joy for your hospitality'
p230
S'This is a great apartment in NYC The upper west side is beautiful and the rooftop patio in this apartment lets you enjoy it the way even most NYC residents aren t lucky enough to do The bedrooms are spacious the apartment is comfortable and nicely decorated Joy was super easy to communicate with This apartment is a 6th floor walk up and then a two story apartment but the exercise allows for eating more of the delicious food the city has to offer'
p231
S'Joy was great everything was as promised the neighborhood is a fantastic place to experience the real NYC Being so close to central park was a real plus for us 12 bucks for a cab ride to times square never hard to get a cab close to the subway too We both felt we had lived like new yorkers'
p232
S'Overall the stay was ok Neighbourhood and outside space great Communication key pick up drop good The description should reflect that the apartment only really sleeps 4 two doubles unless other guest are willing to sleep on a sofa no sofa bed or floor no air mattress Living room would benefit from an a c'
p233
S'The place is really nice The stairs are a challenge but in a good way and you get used to them after you bring up your bags The beds were comfortable and the view great There are tons of restaurants nearby and a great grocery on Amsterdam just around the corner The only issue I had was the neighbor s barking dog Cab ride to plays only cost 8 12 depending on time of day Walk to Lincoln Center easy on a sunny day I recommend Sat Sun brunch at Sarabeth s a few blocks down'
p234
S'The host was very accommodating and made me feel like I was at home with the amenities that were available for my stay The listing was accurate however as a future reference to perhaps mention the amount of flight of stairs that is in the building for people to take into account the luggage they have to haul up to the penthouse The location of the penthouse is in a neighborhood that is surrounded by shops and restaurants It is nice and safe to walk around in the neighborhood Additionally the location of the penthouse was nearby attractions such as Central Park and Times Square The overall experience was fantastic and I had a great time in New York'
p235
S'Joy s place was cozy warm and spacious It is a great price for 2 bedroom 2bath place Location was great and near 1 block from a subway station I was able to move around quickly to all neighborhoods in Manhattan Joy was very responsive and prompt Many good restaurants near with delivery options plenty of cabs and Uber drivers around I even used a fluff and fold laundry service few blocks away to get my laundry done I would definitely at Joy s place again'
p236
S'this was really a wonderful experience for us and Sean and wife really made us feel so welcomed adequate preparation was made for our arrival communication was superb and they were ever ready to help and even go the extra mile to make us comfortable the privacy of the apartment was also good for some quality family time and we really felt at home in the place great people great place'
p237
S'During my stay in NY I stayed in Sean s basement apartment It was one of the few available places still open It was in Queens so not too close to Manhattan but it was comfortable cozy and was affordable Sean was very nice and accommodating I would stay here again'
p238
S'Sean was a very good host Before we arrived Sean sent me everything I would need to ensure I have a smooth arrival Upon arrival Sean had drinks and a cut up watermelon in the refrigerator for us to enjoy He also a box of Moon Pies for us to enjoy The apartment was very clean and described accurately The neighborhood was very safe and the apartment was 4 miles away from the train station There was plenty of places to eat or get food within a 1 2 mile radius The apartment was in the basement so there wasn t any air conditioning but Sean had two fans going and it kept the apartment cool I could not find the wifi password when I arrived I messaged Sean asking for it and within minutes he responded Thanks Sean for everything'
p239
S'It was my girlfriend s first time in NY and both of our first times in Queens We really enjoyed our stay and Sean s place is located close to grocery stores and good eating spots and it s also a close walk to a coupe different trains Super comfortable bed as well'
p240
S'Exactly what it looks like in the pictures Always someone friendly to talk to Very accessible location walking distance to beach grocery store train station and some restaurants Laura is very friendly and always looking out for your best interest trying to do anything to ensure you have the best experience Highly recommend'
p241
S'Location near metro train station 68th St and Line A is very convenient to go to downtown Price is so affordable The house is big beautiful and above all well decorated You almost have everything you need Kitchen is good to use Wi Fi is also good If you have any question Laura will reply very soon The Most beautiful thing is that the house is not too far away from the beach'
p242
S'I am travelling a lot during the year and I can say that I met the best landlord and best people in this house There is something magical I even extended my stay and holiday in NYC because I really felt home in this lovely house Laura is so much fun and energic and taking care of everything for you Bathrooms are so clean and comfortable Kitchen is huge and clean And we have a saloon to get together with people we share the house And whoever steps in during my stay was incredible people Next time for sure I ll be staying here This is the place for the first time I felt at home'
p243
S'Subway is just 2 minutes away you can see the station from the front window The guests are very interesting people from different countries with different talents and personalities Laura is a great host she really made the place feel like home The house itself is cool and has a great vibe a true hostel And the dogs Loved them Some people might find the 1 hour subway ride to mid Manhattan to be a downside but it s not at all bad when you actually try it many New Yorkers take commutes like that every day with no problems I ll recommended Drifter Inn to everyone who s traveling to New York vacation or business P S The Atlantic Ocean is just a four minute walk away and it s cking amazing'
p244
S'This was my first experience ever at Airbnb and it was absolutely amazing I didn t had the chance to meet Laura but Maude is an extraordinary human being kind lovely and the dogs are simply cuteness I loved the place so much so many good vibes in that house and if I ever come back to NY I d stay at Laura s place again for sure'
p245
S'How can we say Absolutely perfect Our experience in NYC has been without problems especially for the Andrea s apartment Everything surrounded the house metro deli loundry Central Park many shops top restaurants theatre Hudson river While outside it was hot the house kept the freshness in both rooms July in NY is very hot We used Air condition only for lunch hottest time Sofa is the king of livingroom never forget to try it once time or day just to see 30 min of Netflix before sleeping Bathroom too little but it works There isn t elevator but the stairs are cold and precious for keep fit everyday We suggest this perfect nest for 2 person couple or friends See you soon NYC see you soon Ulper West Side Andrea and Andrea from Milan Italy'
p246
S'I loved everything about Andreas place its big huge for NY confortable the shower works perfectly and the internet connection was really fast If you turn on the dimmer lamps the atmosphere gets super cool and cozy I am very keen on the UWS for it s seinfield esque vibe and it s direct subway line to my work in Chelsea There s an amazing sushi place 2 blocks away and a very nice park on the corner'
p247
S'Sindy was a great host provided quick responses and detailed instructions about the apartment The room was clean and it came with all amenities needed The room however is facing a very busy road and it s extremely noisy at night Cars motorcycles trucks trains and sirens all night long If you are a light sleeper ear plugs are a must'
p248
S'It was really good experience for us It was our first time with airbnb and we were pretty lucky for first time The room was very good and clean Sindy is very helpful and kind The location is good you can walk to subway it is really easy Thank you Sindy for everything'
p249
S'Sindy was great The beds were great and comfortable and perfectly suited me my husband and our two children that we were travelling with The apartment is close C Town on Liberty Avenue so shopping for groceries was easy The apartment is also close about 10 mins walk to Jamaica Van Wyck and Jamaica Metro stations so it was easy to go to Manhattan and avoid New York road traffic The only downside is that we had to share the toilet with guests in the other two rooms although we coped with the sharing because the information is clear on the listing and we already prepared our minds to share'
p250
S'This was definitely one of the best experiences with airbnb in NYC Sindy s place is very well maintained has everything you need even more Seriously a lot more than you usually get with airbnb It s very close to the subway the neighbourhood is quite fine and the room itself is very clean and comfy It s a pain to find a budget place to stay in NY and we re glad we found one'
p251
S'It was very easy to communicate with Cindy The room kitchen and the bathroom were very clean Beds were very comfortable Everything we needed was provided However the earplugs provided are a must for this room Next time we would stay in the rooms on the other side of this house'
p252
S'I travel alot this location by far is top on my list fresh clean linen clean room very clean common areas The host has so much information concerning the area tht it would be impossible to get lost lol the host was extremly polite and accomadating to our late arrival If i return to nyc i will seek out this host because they take hosting very serious and do everything to make their guests comfortable 5 stars across the board'
p253
S'Sindy was amazing very helpful and she had everything set out Easy to find location and instructions The subway was nearby and it only took 45 min to get to the city She had complementary things which was amazing for us when we were on the go Ten out of ten would recommend to anyone'
p254
S'I m not the type to take time for writing a review but this spot is worth it I felt like I was staying in a mini hotel like room When I arrived the housekeeper had just finished tidying up the room and she did a very good job I liked the privacy of not needing to interact with anyone to check in codes were given to access keys very detailed but simple instructions The rooms was very clean all instructions on paper with wifi info transportation info etc The kitchenette area was clean The bathroom was clean and had extra clean towels as did the rooms Overall an amazing place to stay if you want your privacy a clean place to stay at an amazing price Only a 30 min train ride to the city so the location wasn t too bad'
p255
S'We had a good stay at Maryam s house even though it was only for one night The room was huge the beds were very comfortable Unfortunately the sliding door for the shower was broken when we got there there are other renters in the house so whoever broke it may have not reported it so we had to squeeze our way into the tub the toilet wasn t flushing the morning that we were about to leave which made the bathroom experience a little uncomfortable We did communicate this with them they were quick to fix the sliding door although we didn t use the shower again after the first time The house is located right in front of a sorta busy street our room was closest to the road so we could hear cars passing by through the night it s no problem if you re a heavy sleeper but it s another story when you re a light sleeper P Overall though we spent most of our time in the bedroom so we were comfortable It almost felt like a hotel room because of the room size the beds'
p256
S'I do recommend staying in this location since is a really close to LaGuardia and JFK Airport Has a gas station two blocks away where you can buy anything you want and the train station is not far at all even though is a long trip to get to Manhattan but is okay I d definitely stay there again'
p257
S'We didn t actually meet but the communication with Vivian and Adem were great We felt completely at home and really enjoyed the garden and a sense of quiet A great pied a terre especially sweet for couples I also enjoyed the proximity to several great museums and the Park Thanks V A'
p258
S'Kimberly was a wonderful host Her home is clean and comfortable The futon topped with memory foam placed on the floor is very comfortable and there is a full bathroom with a shower directly attached to this room This Bonus Room space is down the hall from the ground floor entrance and this area is screened off by a curtain on a tension rod It feels very private I immediately felt at home Kimberly offers information and provides direction as needed The neighborhood is charming and one can find great restaurants and cafes within walking distance I highly recommend her space and look forward to returning the next time I am in NYC on business'

p260
S'Kim has a warm and welcoming personality and her house is very comfortable She has a good sense of organization so that adds to the real BnB feel as she has all your creature comforts readily available She is also an excellent host and her backyard space is a small oasis away from home I lived in this neighborhood in the past but it was nice to be back as a guest while in town renovating my old apartment The area has really picked up with more places to go for food and drinks as well as being a stone s throw from the Barclay s center I was able to find street parking and felt relatively safe parking with out of state plates'
p261
S'Kimberly made us feel warmly welcome from the start Conversation flowed with her and her housemates were friendly and interesting too We had a separate space and entrance with its own bathroom plus a door that opened onto a pleasant yard and deck area Everything was clean and well designed The bed was good too We could visit upstairs or hide away downstairs uninterrupted The neighborhood is terrific surprisingly quiet but right around the corner from Vanderbilt an avenue filled with good restaurants shops and people watching It s only a few blocks from several bus and subway stops Kimberly s young son is friendly and very well behaved We would absolutely stay there again on a future visit It truly felt like a home away from home'
p262
S'Kimberly proposes you a welcoming accommodation housing in Town Hall and in a pleasant district of Brooklyn Rather close to the subway and in three stations resorts of Manhattan A practical and comfortable space in a family atmosphere All the necessity a good cooking a good shower a music television a computer I am 80 years old and I do not cavort any more on pavements But it was really good to matter count with Kimberly Which it more is a real cordon bleu blue tie'
p263
S'The perfect stay Great neighborhood Close to Barclays prospect park botanical garden and Brooklyn museum Kim was very welcoming She felt like family The bed was so comfortable So much so that we are buying the same foam memory topper and mattress We had our own bathroom which was an extra plus She provided us with bagels and surprised us with cupcakes and candles to celebrate turning 30 this year She even let us borrow umbrellas and coats due to the cold and rainy weather Would definitely stay again'
p264
S'It s hard to put how great this experience was into words Kimberly was beyond a great host She opened up her home to me and my mom as if we were old friends The home and room itself were great bed super comfortable and the bathroom was very nice The location is perfect close to multiple trains and great restaurants I will be back again and again'
p265
S'I had the opportunity to stay with Kimberly during my time in New York for work and she was a wonderful host who was extremely nice and very helpful She was hospitable and told me I could make myself at home and was easy to strike up a conversation with which made it feel like I was staying with a personal friend more than a host Not knowing the area at all Kimberly also recommended places for me to eat get coffee etc and directed me on how to get there within just a short walk Her home was clean very comfortable and it was an enjoyable stay I definitely recommend anyone consider her place if they re going to be staying in the Brooklyn area'
p266
S'Kimberly was lovely very welcoming and so helpful made me feel right at home The room was snug and warm Great to have the shower room off the bedroom Very convenient with subways to all parts of NY nearby Kimberly was happy to give me advice on how to find places and giving suggestions of places to visit Pleasant and safe location and great having shops just around the corner Loved my first airbnb stay and trip to NY A thumbs up and big thank you from me Janice'
p267
S'Kimberly was just an excellent host I had a friend coming in from out of town who needed a place to stay for the night She made my friend feel welcome and he told me that the room was extremely comfortable and private I would definitely recommend Kymberly as a host'
p268
S'The Bonus Room in Townhouse was exactly as listed It was in a quiet neighborhood We felt very safe walking at night Kimberly was out of the country but always replied to my questions We were welcomed graciously by Anna Kimberly s roommate She gave us a tour of the house and even had bagels and chocolate for us We were there for only 2 nights but would go back again'
p269
S'I really enjoyed my stay at Kimberly s beautiful home The neighborhood is awesome and conveniently located near several subway stops restaurants and coffee shops and the room itself is great with private bath and a super comfy mattress The only negative of my stay is I wish I had had more time to hang out with Kimberly She s such a wonderfully warm and genuine person and her roommates are all so kind and welcoming and were very patient with my delayed arrival you won t regret staying here'
p270
S'I LOVED the neighborhood It was very safe lots of restaurants and completely walkable I stayed here to run the Brooklyn Half Marathon and it was within walking distance of the start line BTW the start line was near the Brooklyn Zoo and Botanical Gardens The room I rented was perfect for what I needed It had a completely private bathroom and it s own entrance I had access to the kitchen upstairs but I didn t need it However it was nice to have that available Please note that there is not a bed instead you get a futon I was surprised by that but I realized that was my fault as Kimberly clearly listed it and I missed it I m tall but the futon was still very comfortable Also Kimberly had just finished washing the bed linens and they smelled great when I went to sleep This was the 1st time using an airbnb I was very nervous but I must say it worked out very well Also Kimberly was very knowledgeable about how to get around and provided lots of information which was very useful I also appreciated the chocolate treats'
p271
S'Kimberly is one of the nicest people we have had the pleasure of staying with via AirBnb She gives great detailed directions to her home which is centralized location and a quick walk to Park Slope Prospect Park She made sure we had fresh towels and we re comfortable in her space Would recommend very highly if you re looking for a great value in Brooklyn and a warm welcoming host Hope to stay here again sometime'
p272
S'Kimberly was a fantastic host I arrived quite late to her house and received a warm welcome Kimberly made me feel right at home I had a seamless albeit brief stay I d highly recommend this option to anyone visiting NYC I also really enjoyed staying in Brooklyn away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan which is just a few stops away via subway'
p273
S'Kimberly is an excellent host She was very welcoming friendly and helpful The accommodation was exactly as what we were expecting and the en suite room is in the basement so was private with its own entrance Location wise it was perfect a few blocks from the subway and lots of places to eat locally Overall an excellent place to stay and I would certainly recommend staying here for others Thanks again Kimberly'
p274
S'Kimberly is an exceptionally good host I felt very welcomed and cared for The space in the lower floor is reasonably private with a very nice updated bathroom and it has direct access to the pleasant backyard The location is just great I only wish I could have stayed longer to explore this wonderful Brooklyn neighborhood'
p275
S'GREAT LOCATION cant stress that enough Kimberly was an absolute delight and did nothing but make our stay comfortable Outstanding host More than accommodating and quick to respond to any questions we had We loved our stay in Brooklyn and NY as a whole and she our temporary space was in large part to thank for that Forever grateful'
p276
S'Kimberly is a very warm and friendly host She went out of her way to make our stay pleasant and easy We happened to visit during a heat wave in New York Although there is no AC the room stays remarkably cool thanks to a fantastic high tech ceiling fan and fresh air from the back yard Futon IS very comfortable and there are also comfy couches for hanging out on in the evening Location is fantastic around the corner from bars and restaurants Just a short walk to the subway'

S'Patric and Carl were lovely hosts They make you feel super welcome and provided me with lots of info about the area and how to get there Forte Green area feels completely different to Manhattan and definitely worth staying if you are looking for a more homely stay Also felt safe for a single female traveler The room is very big and quiet and it was great to have access to the kitchen and laundry area The only thing I was not very fond of but this is entirely personal was the rather hard bed with sheets and cover rather than a duvet comforter and the scented candle But again this is purely personal as I am very sensitive to smells In all great stay great hosts Thank you'
p351
S'We really enjoyed our stay at Patric s place He made us feel very welcome and was super helpful with dropping off bags etc The room itself was gorgeous very spacious and luxurious and had everything we needed The guy we shared the kitchen and bathroom with was very nice and everything was always clean The location is great especially in fall picturesque brownstone streets it was a nice balance spending the days on Manhattan and then having great restaurants and cafes in Brooklyn to explore for breakfast and dinner Definitely recommend this place for your New York getaway'
p352
S'Patric is a lovely host helping always answered my questions He gave us some great recommendations in the area Fort green park is a great area quiet but still with a lots of restaurants and coffees Also it s close to transport Patric s place is really cozy comfortable and charming in really old house Patric has great attention and provide little things who makes his place like home I loved it I recommend for sure'

p354
S'Patric is a great host Always takes the time to answer any questions The room is big and clean with a shared kitchen and bathroom with another guy who is renting the other appartment on this floor We only saw him one time so your privacy is still guaranteed The area is great as well Nice to walk around and see the normal live of Brooklyn with lots of good restaurants very close by You can walk to the Brooklyn Bridge Manhattan bridge Brooklyn Heights etc If you want to go to Manhattan or other parts of NYC there are lots of subways in the nearby area as well We really enjoyed our time over there and definitely stay again'

S'This place is amazing Comfy clean roomy wonderfully decorated and in a perfect location The apartment is right between the G and the C train which will easily take you everywhere you want to go or if not to a major hub that will We felt so at home here which really made the trip that much better The hosts are super friendly and available but not intrusive For a week we felt like we actually lived in a New York garden level apartment'
p356
S'David is an amazingly gracious and considerate host Following an unfortunate mix up with our original accommodation in Forte Green David came to the rescue with amazing care and consideration As he was friends with our original host he offered us his place to stay while airbnb sought to resolve the situation so we found ourselves at David s he even ran out into the monsoon that struck to carry our luggage up the 2 flights of stairs and while it was not our original destination of choice he oriented us to the area and made us feeling incredibly welcome His apartment is modern and spacious and perfectly situated opposite Prospect Park a hub of interesting events activities and beauty with subway access just a block away and plenty of amazing restaurants in the area If you are looking for a simple comfortable and quiet abode from which to explore Brooklyn or travel into Manhattan this is a solid option with a first class host'
p357
S'We had to make a last minute change David was accommodating and helpful about this He met us at door with keys and gave us a good intro to apartment which was clean quiet and very convenient for us It was exactly as billed on airbnb We look forward to staying with him again when we are in Brooklyn'
p358
S'It s a great apartment right on the park and a block from the subway A great place to stay with kids Parking was surprisingly easy to find as well David was a good host he provided us with everything that we needed and then left us alone to enjoy the stay which I appreciate I would definitely recommend this apt to anyone Thanks David'
p359
S'Dave was a great host He came and met us at the door and showed us around the apartment He was easy to get hold of when there were questions and was very generous letting us check out late because we had a night flight I would be happy to give Dave s South Slope apartment 5 stars except there were one or two little things that just hold it back That said I know that Dave will do his best to make any guest feel comfortable and welcome'
p360
S'David did everything right He communicated as needed and let us know he was available but did not intrude at all The place was clean We had everything we needed in the apartment and were very comfortable The kitchen is well equipped The mattresses are firm and comfortable the air conditioner worked well and the water pressure was good There is a good shower and a big deep lean back bath tub The towels were good big ones There is even a small washer dryer combo Everything worked as it should It felt home like There is a big park across the street where my husband walked each morning The apartment is on the 3rd floor so one must be able to climb stairs'
p361
S'Our family just moved to Brooklyn and David s place was the perfect spot for us to settle while we waited for our apartment to be ready Being so close to Prospect Park was a deal breaker the kids loved it David was very helpful and was ready to get us setup and comfortable I d recommend this for anyone traveling with small kids'
p362
S'Our 10 day stay at Maba s apartment in Brooklyn was quite simply fantastic The house is a beautiful townhouse with loads of space and stylishly decorated Maba really goes out of his way to make sure the house is clean tidy and comfortable Location wise it s very close to the 4 and 3 subway trains which will take you into Manhattan which we did everyday without any problems And finally Maba What a great host A genuinely good guy who was so helpful and friendly to us and really helped make our stay in NY all that we hoped it would be Highly highly recommend 10 10'
p363
S'Great place with great host The room as whole building is newly renovated in very modern style The living room and kitchen which we were allowed to use freely are so big that we could always find a place just for ourselves or if we wished stay and have a talk with the host or other guests As the room has a window in the ceiling it s very quiet The air conditioning in the room could be better'
p364
S'Maba is really friendly and kind host He helped everything and welcomed us always with a smiley face House is totally the same with the pictures Furnitures are all new and clean You can find all of the equipment at the house you want Air condition is perfect and kitchen is well equiped There is a bbq at the back Towels sheets and bathroom were also perfectly clean Location is only one street away from the subway you can walk easily Also around the house you can find groceries and markets Communication with Maba is really easy about having the keys to the house We felt like we are at home And i will definitely visit him again thank you Maba'
p365
S'1 Arrival Maba made sure to send me a welcome text immediately after I was accepted I let him know that my flight would be coming in earlier than the listed check in and he gave me the option of dropping off my luggage and hanging out in his living room which was furnished with a comfy couch T V complimentary fresh coffee and the entry way to his perfect backyard with bbq grill and dining table His guests ended up leaving earlier than anticipated and he was incredibly responsive and accommodating of my changing arrival time I passed by several markets to get to his place where I ended up being meat and produce for breakfast 2 The room I stayed in the skylight room with an incredibly comfortable bed very clean closet with hangers that fit our clothes and luggage nicely also comes with a T V which we didn t end up using because we preferred to spend time with Maba and Helena 3 The hosts The greatest people you will ever meet They also invited us to have a Labor Day dinner with their friends who were also amazing Not only are they wonderful people they are also wonderful chefs They really know how to use their barbeque grill Also even though they had guests my friend and I still managed to nap for a bit in our room upstairs as they kept their noise level to a minimum and were very respectful Seriously ask them for recommendations they know their stuff Ample Hill Creamery really is the best ice cream ever They kept the house beautifully clean and were constantly checking in with us about how we were enjoying their house and New York I d highly recommend a stay with Maba and Helena to anyone Best Airbnb hosts I have ever had'
p366
S'The friendliness and hospitality of Maba and Helena cannot emphasized enough We felt so welcome and at home staying with them and I was tempted to just stay and start paying rent Maba and Helena were always available to help us when we had a need and they were also very respectful of our space and privacy when we wanted to do our own thing It was just so easy The house is absolutely gorgeous and the setup was very convenient with the bathroom kitchen and sleeping accommodations I have no complaints with the space or location All of the above were awesome I would definitely stay with Maba again for my next NYC trip'
p367
S'If you need a place in Brooklyn this is it The house is easy to find the street parking is murder but it is Brooklyn and is in an easy area for moving about the city The outside is charming but when we entered the house we were very impressed by how nice it is Maba and Helena keep it spotless and well decorated Bright and comfortable We had the skylight room and it was quiet and had everything needed The shared bath is very nice and since you only share it with one other room there wasn t a problem of not being able to use it The kitchen is stocked with everything you might need and Helena and Maba are very accommodating if you would like to cook Wasn t awkward at all But I must say the best part of the trip was Helena and Maba themselves Nicer people you will not meet They are the kind of couple you like instantly and forever Very kind and interesting they have picked their perfect field of hospitality Will totally stay again'
p368
S'Maba and Helena are two really nice and lovely hosts They are adorable and we had a great time together They gave us suggestions for the best restaurants and went to an icecream store with us Their house is amazing and very clean We were allowed to cook and use everything we want The location of this Airbnb is really good The train station is only 5 minutes walk away and there is an express subway to Manhattan It was wonderful and made our New York experience even better Thank you for this amazing place to stay'
p369
S'Maba and Helena are excellent hosts and really make you feel welcome in their home It felt more like staying with friends than just renting a room All pictures are very accurate and the room very comfortable Their house is situated in a nice and quiet neighbourhood with easy distance to the tube Recommended D'
p370
S'It was a perfect stay The house and the bedroom are beautiful and clean The neighbourhood is cool metro at 3 minutes from home But the most important thing to say is that Maba and Helena are great hosts they are very welcoming friendly and helpful You will feel like home in that place'
p371
S'About our host Their hospitality and warm hearts are all that make the stay more than enjoyable During our stay we never once felt like guess but more like friends Every morning there was brewed coffee freshly made from fresh grounded coffee beans With so much insight and advice on where to go throughout the 5 Boroughs it really made out trip to New York City a grand adventure So glad to have met them and fortunate that we were able to get to know them I would most definitely stay again and highly recommend them bar none'
p372
S'Maba is well deserving of his five star rating His place is spacious modern and spotless He was attentive to all our needs while at the same time giving us space and privacy We felt safe in his neighbourhood and it s less than five mins walk to the nearest subway station Would stay here again when visiting New York'

p375
S'Our family mom dad 4 year old and 10 month old recently stayed in David s apartment for a month while repairs and renovations were done on our place which is nearby David was an extremely gracious host He was kind and laid back during our stressful relocation process which really helped alleviate some of our stress And the apartment was great It s right across from an entrance to the park I took the kids for long walks on the nature trails and we loved opening our curtains every morning and seeing the green meadow and the fall leaves Now that we re back in our home we ve stayed in touch with David whom we re glad to have as a neighbor'

p377
S'David is a very welcoming host and it was nice to know that he was just upstairs in the building because my mother and mother in law were staying there by themselves He was very responsive to texts and email The apartment is wonderfully situated directly across from beautiful Prospect Park and is just steps from the F G subway trains at 15th Street Prospect Park The area is very quiet and safe with great restaurants in Windsor Terrace and Park Slope The beds are comfortable and the place is full of light and very spacious the two small bedrooms would be great if you are visiting with kids'
p378
S'David was a great host from when I first inquired about the place to the moment we checked out He made sure there was enough space for sleeping before accepting the reservations He was very responsive to questions leading up to our arrival Waited outside for us when we arrived to avoid any confusion and walked us through the apartment to get us settled in and left us to relax and explore He was kind to leave epsom salt for us knowing we were in town for a half marathon The apartment is as described in fact the bathroom has seen improvement since the photos Amazing location directly across from Prospect Park and within 5 mins to a subway station and local restaurants It s a perfectly sized NY apartment perfect for a crash pad but with enough room and amenity apple TV wifi dvd player to stay in if needed Overall great host great apartment great stay'
p379
S'Our host David was great Upon our arrival he made us feel at home answered questions and gave us a detailed breakdown of the area During our entire stay he was attentive to any questions we had regarding the apartment the neighborhood etc This Brooklyn location is beyond compare if you want a great family neighborhood feel without all of the density of New York In addition the area has great shops restaurants the park and much more all conveniently located Three adults stayed comfortably in the apartment for 1 month while commuting easily to the city every morning David is a wonderful host and his place could not have been better'
p380
S'I booked David s apartment for a business trip for two employees We had trouble with our dates and David was very flexible with us which we appreciated While the place is very minimally furnished everything that was needed was there The bathroom is especially nice The neighborhood is great and being across the street from the park is lovely I would recommend this apartment especially if you are planning on being out and about and enjoying the city Nice simple and efficient Thank you David'
p381
S'A great spot looking over Prospect Park in a quiet little neighborhood with easy access to the subway The apartment was simple but had everything we needed David was very responsive to communications and helpful getting us oriented upon check in We are glad we followed his recommendation of the East Wind restaurant a block away some of the best Chinese small bites we ve had'
p382
S'Alexis has got to be the kindest most accommodating Hostess I truly have ever met She responded to every question need request so quickly even when she was half way around the world I felt very safe in her apartment and the subway was literally right around the corner One of the biggest perks was her friendly feline Ozzie He greeted me each day I came through the door and is the sweetest little guy ever Thank you Alexis Ozzie for making my trip so special you both are the best'
p383
S'Quita is a nice and welcoming host she stayed up late as our flight was delayed and the husband gave us directions to the place It was a little bit of a stretch from JFK but definitely not bad My wimpy cousin didn t like the neighborhood especially at night but i didn t mind it at all I would recommend staying at Quita s place and i d check it out again if needed The place was clean was that worked for me'
p384
S'Quita was very accommodating even though we were late due to navigating the weekend subway service changes The room and bathroom were clean and the kitchen has a microwave toaster oven kettle and lots of space in the fridge great for keeping and reheating some breakfast or supper 10 min walk to the subway just exercise some caution at night'
p385
S'Communicating for check in and check out was smooth Location was just right for our NYC trip I used C line from Ralph station to go to Manhattan and it was easy Late night on the way back we had to pay attention because we didn t know about neighborhood but was ok The room was clean and we were satisfied with our stay'
p386
S'The overall experience was good I only have three complaints about this listing One of them was the communication with the host I texted Quita before our flight and when we landed I never got a reply My friend and I decided to show up anyways There was a friendly man at the apartment building to greet us but it would have been nice to know that before hand After the man opened the door with a tricky lock another issue we settled in The apartment has a CLEAN kitchen and bathroom and the room has a closet with hangers Although the apartment smelled nice our room had a bit of a strange smell Besides the smell the tricky locks and communication with Quita the listing is not bad I was comfortable and the other guests were no bother at all'
p387
S'Outstanding stay at Ms Quita s place Very clean modern and organized place Everything in the description is 1000 accurate Ms Quita was very helpful she even came personally to check on us day 2 of our visit and check in and out were super easy Very convenient commute to the city Overall my guest and I had an excellent stay'
p388
S'Our first airbnb experience was at Dayne s amazing apartment It s been absolutely incredible and we have already passed details on to friends who are considering visiting New York next year Dayne was a lovely host who waited up for our late arrival and left us some bagels milk and cheese The apartment was spacious clean cozy comfy nicely furnished and simply great It s a very short walk to the subway which takes you into Manhattan in no time It also has all sorts of amenities within short walking distance 100 recommended'
p389
S'Very flexible when I arrived an hour early Dayne went right over to meet me Only a handful of steps out front then we had the entire first floor to ourselves The upstairs tenant was very nice and didn t get in our way at all There s a nice breeze if you open the windows and on her recommendation we picked a nearby Indian place for delivery once night and a Cuban place in Jackson Heights which I went to pick up My 5 year old was super excited at the bagels that were waiting for us and we had no trouble with subway access N Q stop nearby laundry lots of places 1 2 blocks away and snacks several places on the way from the subway I m not sure if we followed the recycling rules right this was all new to us but hopefully things got to the right place I d stay here again'
p390
S'Dayne was very accommodating in every situation She was very responsive through our messages She made me feel extremely excited for her Airbnb especially when my first experience was dramatizing My cousin was able to check in for the group I never got to meet Dayne but my cousin said she was very nice She even gave up her parking spot so we wouldn t have to struggle finding one around the neighborhood Her home was so cute and super clean I couldn t stop sniffing the fresh towels I love the scent All 6 of us were able to stay in the home comfortably The beds felt just like my bed at home I can t say enough about my second experience I highly recommend her place if you want to spend a weekend in the city Her place is close to a metro stop that made our adventures easy to explore'
p391
S'Dayne was excellent I talked to her on the phone before I was leaving for my trip She researched the best way for me to get to the home from the Newark airport She told me what to do and it was so helpful She was waiting for us upon our arrival When ever we needed anything she was there within 10 minutes She was an awesome host The home is newly renovated beautiful with everything new and exceptionally clean She had coffee bagels milk cream cheese for us It was only a few blocks from the train station The neighborhood was great There s a grocery store right by the station a laundromat too'
p392
S'Dayne was an exemplary host She accommodated my family on very short notice and was an absolute pleasure to work with The apartment was spotless and just as described The backyard was definitely a highlight as it s something that s not too frequently available in New York City The best part though may have been the beds They were SO comfortable'
p393
S'The location is great around half hour you can reach to most of the attractives The apart itself is very clean and enough for 5 adults Dayne let us checkin in early morning so we can have a rest right after one terrible night bus I will absolutely recommend to my friends if they go to visit New York City'
p394
S'Dayne meet us at the apartment She saved us a parking spot right out front The apartment was beautiful and spotless just as pictured It is very comfortable and quiet and is equipped with everything one might need She had coffee milk water for us She left shampoo and plenty of fresh towels in the bathroom She gave us advise on how to get around and what to see in New York The metro is very convenient to her place and is only a short ride to Midtown It was a wonderful stay and I highly recommend'
p395
S'Tania s appartment is a great place to stay Well located in a quiet neighbourhood close to subway lines this is an apartment in which we feel at home and the private garden is great We shared the house with Mocha the cat who s very fun and friendly and after 8 days we were sad to leave her I recommend the place and Tania will be happy to help you with directions or anything you need'
p396
S'Our stay in Tania s place could not have been better The apartment is easily reached by several metro lines and has a lot of cute cafes and places to get groceries nearby It is also walking distance to Atlantic station where you can go to the Brooklyn Flea etc The cat Mocha is very sweet and easy to share the space with The space itself is pretty big for a studio and well designed There are fun little details in the woodwork and tiling that make it clear the space has been kept up but definitely has a long history We never actually got to meet Tania accessing the apartment by lock box which was fine and worked smoothly but I wish we could thank her in person'
p397
S'Staying in Tania s apartment with Mocha the cat turned out to be an unexpected New York pleasure The apartment was beautifully located between the G and C rail lines making it a doddle to get into Manhattan about 30 minutes from her door to midtown I d recommend a 7 day Metrocard for busses and underground trains if you re planning on making more than 12 trips during your stay Though I never got to meet her Tania make sure everything went very smoothly It was too cold for any garden use but very nice to know it was there'
p398
S'Liked the charm of this place and it was very conveniently located The price was certainly right around 80 bucks a night Mocha the Cat was a delight and was nice company during our stay Tania made sure we had all of the right check in check out details and made sure that we had clean towels there were guests staying before us The building does get very cold at night we stayed in late December but probably nothing a few extra blankets couldn t fix'
p399
S'The apartment is perfect Spacious and well taken care of and it even comes with a backyard It was so nice to have a private yard to relax after a day in the city The apartment had everything you need for your stay kitchen is a good size and well stocked The best part of staying here was sharing the space with Tania s cat Mocha Most adorable cat ever and would always greet us when we came in The location is amazing You can t beat having a subway station on the same block We were able to get to any place we wanted to go to in about 20 mins There are great places within a few blocks from the apartment And we were so close to the Brooklyn Flea around the corner it was great Tania is also a great host Her responses were quick and very helpful The check in and check out process was easy I would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone'
p400
S'Stayed at Tania s last weekend for two nights a very quick trip Her apartment was great very true to the pictures Great place parking on the street each night nice area Reservation communication was all very easy Tania is quick to respond Mocha was adorable and a nice addition to the apartment Would definitely recommend Tania s apartment and would definitely stay there again'
p401
S'Tania is a very good host she responded immediatly and made a last minute stay at her apartment possible The communication was very easy and good The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures and Mocha her cat is lovely and ads to the homy atmosphere of the place The subway station is very close just a few steps away yet the place is really quiet and cozy and you can get a good rest during the nighttime Thank you again for your hospitality Tania'
p402
S'We stayed at Tania s for 3 nights Her place is lovely clean and quiet and has a great backyard It was very close to the metro and around the corner from the Fort Greene flea While I never met Tania in person she was very helpful and accommodating I d highly recommend staying in her place'
p403
S'Tania s flat is a very artistic studio convenient to numerous subway lines and with a gorgeous backyard patio space We enjoyed sitting out there with the lights on in the evening We didn t meet Tania but she was great about communicating before and during our stay even texting back quickly when we had a couple of questions The neighborhood is beautiful and safe though this building seems a bit more rundown Our primary problem during our stay was the lack of air conditioning Although it is advertised the unit was broken mosquitoes were a big issue when we opened the window and note that you are supposed to leave the window open during the day for the cat Mocha so we spent some hot nights with the windows closed I was disappointed Tania who was very detailed about everything else failed to disclose this problem before we arrived'
p404
S'Charming studio and so close to 2 different lines of subway in Clinton Hill area Forte Green Flea Market is literally behind the apartment complex which is such a plus It s the perfect location for those that are looking for Brooklyn experience outside of Williamsburg Tania was very easy to connect with so I recommend this place to anyone travelling to NYC on a budget The only flaw very small is due to the age of the building the bathroom was not ideal weak shower water pressure slow drainage finicky toilette etc Again very small flaw Overall great location great price close to transportation quiet neighbourhood and good Host so I recommend this place'
p405
S'The studio apartment was perfect Comfortable bed well equipped kitchen and bathroom all worked out great It was extremely easy to find get the key and use the apartment Great location easy access to fun in Brooklyn and transportation Tania was quick to answer any and all questions we had Thanks'
p406
S'Me and my friend had a great time during our stay at Tania s place Everything was as described The apartment is cozy and perfect for a short stay We discovered a new neighborhood in Brooklyn for us with great spots and nice areas Too bad we could not take advantage of the garden winter time but it adds a great value We appreciated the TV and Netflix at home when coming back after a long day in the city The cat was also a great companion and not annoying at all I definitely recommend this place'
p407
S'The good points Mocha the cat was adorable and a lovely addition to the house The garden and the lighting in it were lovely Good location safe neighbourhood TV Made good use of Netflix a nice way to relax at the end of the day The room was well presented and nicely styled exactly as shown in the picture Tania is a good host responded quickly to any queries which we had and was very polite and helpful throughout our stay Criticisms The shower it was very difficult to regulate the temperature and the pressure wasn t particularly strong The apartment was not as clean as it could have been dust on surfaces saw a cockroach once though it could have entered through an open window No wardrobe or storage space for clothes provided Cold inside the flat and unable to regulate heating though temperatures outside were warm for the time of year so not too much of an issue for us Kitchen very small not especially clean so had no desire to cook Overall Some issues but we were satisfied overall Pretty good value for money pleasant helpful host and amazing cat and a good location'
p408
S'Tania s apartment was clean comfortable and in a fun part of Brooklyn She wasn t there to meet us but her instructions to enter the apartment were concise We loved hanging with her cat Mocha who was friendly and independent The apartment was quiet and only a few blocks from the subway which takes you to Manhattan and Long Island City Restaurants and shops close by Thank you Tania'
p409
S'Michael made us feel very welcome even though we were unable to meet in person since we arrived fairly late that evening Obtaining the key getting access to wifi etc were all smooth The neighborhood is very nice but not super busy if you re looking for something to do That being said it s a short walk from the metro and when we stayed there we did find a cool hole in the wall bar to grab a drink close by too We loved staying in Brooklyn visiting Manhattan and staying at this listing'
p410
S'Hard to find a better deal than this in New York Clean room comfy bed and a really cool hood Both hosts were very friendly and cool to chat with I got some great recommendations from Michael and where to eat and drink It can be a bit of a roll of the dice when sharing a bathroom with so many other guests but for the price you will get more than your value s worth I d stay here again'
p411
S'We had a great time in New York and happy to stay in Michaels appartment Michael an Marie are lovely people The room is big and had two windows Comfortable bed We liked the neighbourhood stores and coffeeplaces are close A 10 minute walk to the subway or the bus right in front of the house You share the appartment with other guests there are 4 rooms Nice that you can use the washing machine And that there is coffee and snacks Recommended'
p412
S'The place is nice and well equipped I recommend it since the place is quite cheap according to the NYC tag The food items in the kitchen were URL HIDDEN was a small room and worth the low price if you ll be out the whole day The bed was super comfortable too I truly recommend this place and certainly will come back'
p413
S'Michael s place is in Brooklyn a quiet and safe neighborhood It s not too far from lower Manhattan and other neighborhoods in the boro It s more of a hostel type accommodation so expect to run into other guests We only stayed for one night so it was fine for our quick trip into the city'
p414
S'Pros EVERYTHING this is a great place to stay It s anything you can imagine for an Airbnb Cons Not as close to a subway station This really isn t a con if you down for the walk or want to Uber Lyft to the subway Overall I enjoyed my stay with M M'
p415
S'We LOVED our stay with Erin Emily and Cherie the pup in their great apartment They were so welcoming and we felt so at home straight away Erin was massively helpful before during and even after our stay arranging a smooth check in despite being out of town and she and Emily gave us tonnes of recommended places to eat and things to do in the L E S including a hand drawn map The room is fab with the comfiest bed ever It is on the small side but there was comfortable room enough for both of us with two months worth of luggage each We weren t bothered by the noises from the street at night it s relatively quiet for a big city with popular bars right outside so no issues for us there It s very convenient for the delancey Essex subway stop which will take you uptown in 15 mins and we loved getting fresh fruit from the Essex market each day We d also highly recommend Souvlaki the Greek restaurant round the corner for dinner best on our trip by far Can t recommend Erin s place enough we were sorry to leave and if we ever return to NYC we d definitely stay again Thanks girls x'
p416
S'Erin was friendly like really super friendly She made us feel right at home and was even so nice as to give us a HUGE list of places to eat when we asked complete with links to everything Seriously she s the best host one could ask for The apartment decorations are really fun and artsy and the neighborhood is hard to beat Thanks so much for making our weekend in NYC so great Erin'

S'Erin and her roommates were incredibly nice and accommodating She gave us a list of good places to eat check out in the neighborhood as well as a hand drawn map on arrival and there was a big sign in the living room welcoming us VERY cute Good fast communication as well The apartment is adorable and in a great neighborhood You could not ask for a place close to the subway and there s multiple lines that make it a good hub for exploring Manhattan but LES by itself is a great neighborhood and the apartment is down the street from at LEAST 3 4 great places to go out eat drink and see live music And if you go out in another neighborhood there s a McDonalds by the station for easy late night food runs Seriously I could rave about how great a location this is all day There s an expected amount of street noise but the room is surprisingly quiet at night We re pretty shy and were nervous about our first Airbnb experience but we had a fantastic experience and would recommend Erin s place for anyone staying in NYC'

S'Erin was an incredible host Her place really is a giant Pinterest board but not only was it beautiful it was comfortable It was in a great location and Erin suggested tons of places to eat My friend and I were there for a Broadway show and she even suggested other plays to see She was very accommodating to our itinerary as well All around a wonderful stay'

p436
S'Erin was really great she was very welcoming The posting of her room was accurate She sent us a list of cool places in the neighbourhood to eat and drink which was really helpful and exciting The directions from the airport was also helpful We had a great time in Erin s apartment which is located in a super part of Manhattan Erin was very kind and let us leave our bags until we left at 2 for the airport after a super time in NYC'
p437
S'Erin is very friendly cheerful and welcoming We enjoyed our stay at her place Erin herself is very quiet and often we would not know whether she was home or not The feeling of privacy was very much appreciated Though the place is compact and the noise from below outside is more or less a constant It s New York after all and a really lively area at that we had everything we needed and spent a very nice week or so staying with Erin I myself am a deep sleeper I wasn t affected at all by the noise from below My husband sleeps much lighter but he got by just fine using the ear plugs Erin provided The key pick up was convenient the location was great for getting around using public transport Thanks for everything Erin'
p438
S'We really enjoyed the LES area and the surrounded areas like Soho Erin made our stay very comfortable She wasn t at home when we arrived so she left the keys at city copilot only 2 blocks away from the appartment At the day we left we could stay as long as we wanted The room is very cosy and we liked the tips Erin gave us'
p439
S'We had a great stay at Erin s place The cute apartment is clean and in a great location for accessing Manhattan s sites bars restaurants As the listing says the street has bars on it and it gets quite noisy at night Erin helpfully provides earplugs But also be aware that smoke from people smoking outside the bars below can be smelt in the room sometimes The room has aircon in it and the mattress is very comfy'
p440
S'My stay at Erin s apartment is very joyful I have never really explored this part of New York before staying here but now I m completely in love with the Lower East Side an area full of restaurants cafes bars galleries clothing shops oh and most importantly grocery shops There are at least 5 groceries within 5 min walk Duane Reade is around the corner so is the F M B D J station I ve been taking advantage of the warm September to walk as much as I can especially when I need to Soho Nolita East Village and Chinatown As for the apartment it looks exactly like the pictures Bathroom and kitchen are kept clean Cookware and tableware are provided Bed is comfy Although some of the comments mentioned the noise level due to the bars below the window on Friday and Saturday nights it s not really an issue for me It a lively area in New York just like many others And Erin has made it very clear in her descriptions Thank you Erin and Pup the most adorable chihuahua in the world for making me feel like home'
p441
S'This place was great We loved it Erin and her dog were so sweet We celebrated new years here and the area was good There were a lot of noise from the street you could even hear people talking but we were so tired after walking around in NYC so it doesnt really matter to us We would love to come back'
p442
S'Erin is absolutely wonderful I had a long term stay with her while I had an internship out of town and she was so sweet and helpful answering all my questions and making sure I had everything I needed Her place is exactly as she describes Comfy room great location close to the subway and lots of good restaurants bars and shopping within walking distance It does get loud on the weekends but it never bothered me and is a small price to pay to be in the heart of the city 10 10 would recommend staying with Erin whenever you re in NYC'
p443
S'We stayed with my fianc and 1 5 year old daughter at Koen s and Min s apartment for a week this summer The apartment is spacious and well furnished The building is a doorman building at an ideal location between Brooklyn Heights and Brooklyn downtown that provides both great connections for trains to Manhattan and peace quiet of brownstone streets Dealing with Koen was quick easy Our daughter was overjoyed with the immense collection of toys available at the apartment and enjoyed spending time at the great playgrounds in nearby Cobble Hill Koen Min also provided us with a travel crib and stroller which made our trip that much easier to manage The apartment was perfect for our stay in NYC Couldn t recommend more'
p444
S'Our short stay at Kal s place was near perfection The location and proximity to fun local bars and eateries was wonderful The apartment was small but clean and well equipped The only suggestion I have is that the bedding could have been changed before our arrival While they were by no means dirty fresh sheets are a must in my opinion The bed was firm but quite comfortable The rooftop terrace had great skyline views of the city simply breathtaking I was surprised by how quiet it was inside the studio especially because of its Manhattan location Kal s very effective communication skills and directions were another bonus A stay Would love to come back Thanks again Kal'
p445
S'Amazing trip 9 min walking from Times square the location couldn t be better You can practically find everything you need around and the area is very safe The apartment is very clean and the bed its amazing Kal its a very warming host and he care about us all the trip Definitely a very good experience for 10 days in New York'
p446
S'We had an absolutely wonderful time in New York Kal s place was in a great location for getting around Studio was clean neat well appointed and efficient He was very prompt in his responses I do have a couple of constructive criticisms though that I believe will be helpful to his next guest or guests There were only two bath towels available to my husband and I for the entire week and one washcloth No space anywhere available to hang up one piece of clothing so we were literally living out of our suitcases all week tripping over them There wasn t a top sheet on the bed and I finally did find one in a cupboard to use It would be helpful to have a list of things written down upon arrival i e wifi password tv if it works or not and the exit procedures so you don t have to bug the host with lots of messages Getting into the building was a mystery because there wasn t instructions left with the key With those few minor improvements we would definitely stay again'
p447
S'Kal is a great host The apartment is located right in the middle of Hell s Kitchen making it easily accessible to anywhere The apartment is nicely furnished very clean and extremely comfortable I would recommend this place highly I ve already booked my next trip and this will always be the apartment I check out first'
p448
S'Despite the fact that it was initially difficult getting in touch with Rose regarding her place once the booking was made she was very helpful and the communication was excellent Pros The apartment was clean and the decor was very nice Getting into Manhattan is very very easy as the train line is right there It was about a 20 min walk into Williamsburg which is where we spent the majority of our time The couch and bed are both very comfortable Rose has the kitchen set up with some coffee and granola which was a nice treat The air con was also a bonus Cons The apartment literally sits on the subway tracks and the subway runs all night the noise was unbelievable and made sleep quite difficult In addition to the subway the other side of the apartment faces a nightclub which plays very loud music on the weekends My friend was once woken up to a street fight going on outside the nightclub directly outside of our building Despite the noise we did have a very pleasant trip and were able to explore Williamsburg Greenpoint and a little bit of Manhattan'
p449
S'This place is a very nice apartment its clean organized and I felt very secure The bed is amazingly comfortable so Its great after a long day in Manhattan It has all the necessary things to make you feel comfortable This place is very close to the train station so its very noisy and we didnt sleep much the first day The other days I didnt bother we slept as rocks after walking half Manhattan so It became a minor issue This is actually convenient because we were able to stay late at night in Manhattan It was awesome to just take the train walk a few steps and be at home There s a 24 deli downstairs so there s always people around there at all hours Also the williamsburg bridge its very close and you get a great view of Manhattan from there Its not perfect it s an old building It has an old bath tub but still we had a very good experience and Rose responded perfectly to all my emails'
p450
S'We stayed here for 2 week Rose was great she had a breakfast ready for us on arrival and the place was neat As others say yes the subway is close so close you get the apartment wifi in the station Is very loud during the day but at night you can barely here it from the room The building is nothing to be amaze by but the apt looks as good as in the photos And Rose has all this great stuff around magazines fabrics etc If you wanna rest make sure to leave the place by friday before dawn cos the club in front is as loud as it gets For groceries you are set Right in front of the building you have a deli that s 24 7 and a market a few steps away You are in the edge of Williamsburg no hip stores or restaurants for you but if you want to get to Manhattan you are 2 stations away from SoHo The place is great the subway and the club could get really loud at times but i would definitely go back without thinking it'
p451
S'Rose s place is beautiful With wooden floors very comfortable and tasteful furnishings it s warm in the winter and lets in lots of natural light There was a nice simple breakfast waiting for me after arriving early in the morning and Rose was great with communication The subway is very close which is good for convenience and will see you in Manhattan in minutes but not so good for the noise Most of the time though I d enjoy taking the 15 20 minute walk into Bedford Ave in the heart of Williamsburg I d happily recommend it to anyone'
p452
S'We stayed for 8 days in Rose her apartment and loved it It was clean cozy and only 2 stops from Manhattan The neighborhood was just fine with some decent shops and places to eat and drink When we had questions Rose would react pretty quick through text messages Really convenient The only minus was the train passing aside the apartment but we were used to it within one night All together we had a fantastic time in Rose her apartment Next time in NYC we will book it again Thx Rose for all the effort and your great place'
p453
S'We my girlfriend Helle Vibeke Lysdal and I really enjoyed staying in Rose s apartment It s a great place with a very comfy bed a gorgeous kitchen and located very close to the subway station Yes as Rose has pointed out in the description the apartment is very close to the station so close that you can hear the departure announcements when sitting in the living room But you get used to it and ear plugs were even provided for when you re sleeping It s convenient since there s a deli and a small supermarket very close by and only 1 metro stop between you and Manhattan Rose was very friendly and very quick to reply whenever we had a question All in all we had a great time there and we would definitely stay there again'
p454
S'rose was an absolutely perfect host we actually never met her because she was travelling for work but she made sure that everything was 100 perfect with our stay the place was spotless very spacious and tastefully decorated rose even sent us an email with recommendations for the neighborhood and checked in with us to see how we were doing she was very very friendly and great with all organization and communication we really loved her place and felt like home yes the subway is close but that didnt even bother us we highly recommend rose and her cozy brooklyn appartment we ll be back'
p455
S'Rose s place is really gorgeous a little gem in a very unsuspecting building Its just what we needed lots of space rare for NYC light cute furniture reliable internet etc etc Rose was highly attentive and communicative before my arrival ensuring I knew my way to the apartment and conveniently arranged key pick up as well as providing a long list of places to eat etc As others say its right next to the subway which might bother some but after a day it became kind of white noise to me so not a problem but maybe if you are particularly sensitive to noise it could be Saying that its incredibly handy for getting around you have a main subway at your doorstep Rose left a great selection of magazines some fruit and snacks for us and her bed is SUPER comfortable Would definitely stay here again thanks Rose'
p456
S'Rose s place was so lovely and cozy I definitely enjoyed my stay there It s right next to the subway which is extremely convenient and despite what other reviewers have said the noise from the subway was not an issue at all Rose was more than helpful to give advice on local places to visit which was very comforting I would absolutely recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to stay in Williamsburg And to anyone who loves a good nights rest the bed in this apartment is so comfortable it was often hard to get out of'
p457
S'Rose s apartment was wonderful My friend and I stayed here for almost one month and had no issues with the place It is right next to the subway so very easy to get around The apartment has a great vibe and is decorated really well We never met Rose however arrangements for the stay were dealt with clearly and promptly The place is noisy however after the first two nights we got very used to it and it wasn t an issue Wifi is good kitchen and bathroom are great and bed is comfortable Thanks so much for letting us stay here we had a killer trip in NYC and would recommend this place to others D'
p458
S'Rosie was a great host Her place was clean and very comfortable Great style too My stay was a smooth and easy experience Her place is steps from the subway It s true that it is a little bit loud at night but for anyone who is a light sleeper like I am just bring a pair of earplugs and you shouldnt have any problems Thanks Rosie I would definitely rent from you again'
p459
S'My husband and I stayed at rose s apartment for about 3 weeks Excellent location everything u need at ur doorstep supermarket restaurants laundromat and trains It is a noisy area area with the subway and a bar next door Having said that my husband and I are light sleepers my husband is an extremely light sleeper but we had no problems sleeping at all The apartment itself is lovely We never met rose in person but she was responsive and accommodating with flexible check in and check out We pick up keys from the deli downstairs without any issue'
p460
S'Rose s place is very charming It is right next to the subway which is extremely convenient Yes you can hear it but it never bothered me Almost every night there was noise from people outside around 3am I assume that s when the bars surrounding closed Rose made it very easy to check in and check out and provided a helpful document of things to do places to go and how to get around'
p461
S'Sydney s place is really gorgeous and lovingly furnished It s right next to the subway which is extremely convenient to get to other parts of NY Yes the sound of the train is unavoidable but after the first two nights after we got over the jetlag we got very used to it and it wasn t an issue My boyfriend and I stayed at Sydneys s apartment for about 10 days She made it very easy to check in and check out provided a helpful document of things to do and left some fruits and snacks for us Our connecting flight from Philadelphia to NY was cancelled so we had to take the train Sydney immediately responded and send us an email with the best connection from the destination in NY Penn Station to the apartment Thanks Sydney We would definitely stay here again'
p462
S'I had a great stay here nice safe and convenient location to anywhere in manhattan as well as other parts of brooklyn from the train station just in front of the apartment The train noise is a bit loud but after 1 day i forgot it was there The apartment itself is nice and cosy and its definitely a place i would stay at again Thanks Sydney'
p463
S'Sydney was SO great when we first arrived made us feel very welcome and was really helpful with recommendations for local restaurants etc Her space was really cozy and I honestly did not notice the train noise it s definitely there but not bothersome We enjoyed the company of her cat Teddy SO sweet The one rough spot for us was the 3rd really 4th floor walkup but that is because we are not used to that many stairs Welcome to New York Absolutely would recommend for a great cozy place in Williamsburg RIGHT next to the subway'
p464
S'We got to the apartment quite late but Sydney made it really easy for us to get in still The apartment was in such a great location and was absolutely perfect for us it s was bright and sunny and we really enjoyed our morning coffee sat in the sun drenched kitchen The subway station was indeed so close but it never kept us awake and was only made out stay more enjoyable as it was so easy for us to get to Manhattan and the East village We loved our stay and has the extra bonus of looking after teddy the cat who is so friendly and adorable Would 100 stay here again We miss NYC already'
p465
S'This was my first airbnb experience and it turned out to be quite a delight I stayed here with my boyfriend for a week The pictures of the house and the bedroom are accurate I felt right at home even from the first warm welcome by the sisters There was plenty of street parking available and across the street is the A train The kitchen was fully stocked There was a tv in the living room The hosts were around in the evenings but I still felt like we still had our privacy They responded to texts calls instantaneously The house was kept quite clean and tidy Thanks guys for everything'
p466
S'The description of the apartment was accurate and exactly what I expected Sakinah was very helpful with arranging a meet up time and a departure time Even though she was out of town herself she made herself available via email and was extremely helpful She was a great host and the apartment was exactly what I expected'
p467
S'The studio was just what we needed for our short stay The location is great and convenient only a 1 min walk from the subway station and main strip of shops Sakinah was a great host super friendly and helpful she even had tea and coffee left for us We would definitely stay here again Thanks Sakinah'
p468
S'Sakinah was very friendly and very fast to reply to my emails throughout the whole booking process On arrival she wasn t available but her boyfriend Vidal did the check in he was very helpful and friendly too The studio is exactly as described light airy and clean The neighborhood is great very lively and convenient shops grocery stores and laundromat within 5 minutes walk away and the subway is just around the corner with the 2 and 5 lines which are very reliable and fast All in all it was a great stay I highly recommend this host and studio'
p469
S'Sakinahs place was just what we expected It worked out perfect for my son and I as he is 7 years old and not used to the walking and her apartment is just 2 minutes from the subway station She was in touch and easy to contact the entire trip My son especially enjoyed her musical instruments We definitely enjoyed our stay'
p470
S'Sakinah was really friendly and communicated really well we never had to wait long to get a reply to questions etc She met us after a late flight at just before midnight we stupidly went to the wrong address and she came and found us and took us to the right one Apartment was really nice and very clean Bed was a mattress on the floor it still had the plastic on it which made it a bit slippery and noisy to sleep on but at least you know it s clean Apartment is not in the best area of Brooklyn but is close enough to the metro that this didn t matter as it s only a 2 minute walk to the train straight into Manhattan It was really hot for the 3 nights we were there and although there was no air conditioning Sakinah provided us with 2 big fans which did the job nicely Thanks for a great few days in NYC'
p471
S'The apartment was just as described and looked exactly as shown in the pictures Sakinah had a meeting at our scheduled check in time but I was welcomed by Vidal who showed me around the apartment and pointed out various things that were available to me they had a PS3 and tv to use for Netflix 2 tower fans hotel sized shampoo and soaps and a small router which provided wifi Shakinah continued to keep in contact after I had checked in and was very helpful and easy to reach I had no problems with the studio other than the front door which was a bit tricky to lock and unlock but after the first night I had it down The location was convenient because it is near a laundromat convenience stores some places to eat and is right around the corner from the entrance to the subway Overall I had a great stay and would come back'
p472
S'Sakinah was a great host She was flexible with check in and check out and quickly responded to all of our questions Her apartment is great for a home base while exploring NYC the subway is within a block from her place Food and shops are within blocks as well as a parking garage a few blocks away'
p473
S'The room that you ll be staying in is great and was perfect for my boyfriend and I It s cozy well decorated has plenty of natural light and has backyard access The whole apartment was clean and Ji was incredibly warm and welcoming The train is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment which isn t too bad and the apartment is really close to Manhattan There are also a bunch of great restaurants nearby to try'
p474
S'We had a wonderful time at Ji s place She was hospitable and very accommodating and overall a very genuine person We arrived very early in the AM and left late afternoon and she was happy to make things easier for us the whole stay was smooth The place was very clean and spacious We were able to enjoy ourselves at all times having access to the the living room kitchen and backyard area It was also fully air conditioned we were able to escape the heat and retreat back indoors to break from the bustle of NY streets The subway is about a 10 15 walk depending on active you are We loved it it s a pretty safe area with great restaurants and bards near by Definitely would recommend and book again'
p475
S'Ji has been a wonderful host She was really caring about our stay in New York and let us use everything we needed in the house the kitchen the garden etc Besides that the place is just 10 min away from subway markets and really nice cool spots to eat and have fun Highly recommended'
p476
S'Ji was an awesome host She was very communicative and sweet and offered to meet us at the subway and walk us to her place She made us feel right at home in her apartment L Her place was a short walk to restaurants and shops in greenpoint and maybe half a mile from the subway Though we didn t use it the room had direct access to a sweet little back patio and was a pretty good size for a second bedroom We d definitely stay again'
p477
S'Omg Ji was the sweetest person ever She was super attentive welcoming and answered any of our questions about the neighbourhood Our first night she also got to know us a little bit as well as we got to know her aka she even walked with me to the liquor store Staying there was super comfortable and chill I would totally recommend anyone to stay at her place'
p478
S'We had a great time at Ji s place Ji was so sweet and welcoming and super fast in responding to any of our questions She was also very accommodating and flexible with regard to check in and check out times The place was nice and clean exactly as pictured Thanks again Ji We hope we ll be back sometime'
p479
S'Ji is so nice The room and bed is comfortable The location is good and safe near subway We feel like home in Ji s house The first day we arrive on 2 am so late because the delay of plane But Ji is also waitingfor us She is so kind'
p480
S'Very accurate description of the place that had everything we needed during our stay at a very busy important time Tania helped us feel comfortable while making our journey to this location and provided us with all the information that was necessary along with very easy instructions and help She was also quick to respond to questions that I had'
p481
S'This location is perfect for visiting NYC because it s close to the subway 3 minutes by walk and because it s located in the middle of 2 interesting neighborhoods east village and lower east side The house is also in front of a market and of a wine shop The home is clean and vey well furnished and Tania has been helpful in giving us many suggestions for our staying I would absolutely recommend it'
p482
S'Worst ever Prior to arriving the contact with the owner was almost impossible thus the coordination was very poor The apartment is not suitable for living No electricity in the entrance and in the kitchen Toilet with broken tiles and rusty tubs Holes in the walls and toilet door ruined Images are raken and available upon request Owner offered refund atleast for first day but stoped communicating'
p483
S'Juan s place was perfect for our trip to New York City It is located in a good area in Brooklyn and it is very easy to access Manhattan from there taking the L train which is located within a 7 minutes walk from the appartment It was comfortable and we felt at home everytime when we came back after discovering the city I would recommend it I will come back'
p484
S'This flat is in a great location really close to a few different Metro lines so it s very easy to walk to Williamsburg with all its great bars and restaurants and also get over to Manhattan The flat is larger than it looks in the photos but be aware the walls are a bit thin to next door who are pretty loud good idea to bring ear plugs for sleeping The kitchen has all the facilities you d want and with Walgreens 2 minutes away it s easy to buy stuff in This place was really good for me I was out a lot and just needed a comfortable base It wasn t exactly in perfect condition but it s a much better price than a lot nearby so you get what you pay for no point staying here if you re looking for 5'
p485
S'Very basic flat in a very old and run down building The flat although it was kind of clean dust was still under the beds fridge had food drinks from previous guests reclycle bin was not emptied is quite old and the windows face an internal courtyard The flat is quite noisy as the walls and floors are super thin and you can hear your neighbourgs We stayed over the weekend and it was hard to get a good night sleep without earplugs make sure you take some You should also take a sleeping mask as the courtains do not block the sunlight I guess is the kind of place that will be better for students or people that you just want a no frills experience only one towel per guest no hand soap on the bathroom no towels hangers on the bathroom no ironing board etc The location is not that great like 15 min walk to where you actually want to be in Williamsburg There are a couple of subway stations like 5 10 min walk that are well connected to Manhattan or other parts of Williamsburg Juan was also kind of hard to reach e g the communication was not great For check in as I was not getting any replies from him I had to call Airbnb in order to get a reply from him Not ideal as I spend over 15 min with Airbnb on the phone on an international tariff This expense could have been avoided if Juan just replied to my x 2 messages and x text messages'
p486
S'We stayed one night at Juan s place in Williamsburg in May THE PROS Juan was very friendly and responsive to our arrival worked with on check in which was much appreciated as we were coming from Manhattan and had a lot of luggage The place was clean and the location good close to multiple subway lines and a Citibike station The mattress on the bed was very comfortable A 10 minute walk to Bedford Ave and the heart of the action in Williamsburg THE CONS The building has really thin walls and its easy to hear the neighbors but that s life in an apartment building But still if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs The curtains in the bedroom was very thin and the security light outside is very bright Some of the furniture especially the bedframe is flimsy and needs repair Toilet seat needs repair and the walls were scuffed and dingy BOTTOM LINE If you re not too fussy it s an OK spot to perch for a night or two especially if you are planning on being out a lot I wouldn t recommend for a long stay or if you need to work'
p487
S'I made the mistake of booking this place hastily based on its location and the photos without reading the reviews so I found myself facing all the issues described in earlier comments Most annoying and upsetting was the lack of communication by Juan Ultimately I found myself at 11 pm at night standing in front of a locked door with no key and no answer to my multiple texts and airbnb messages for 15 minutes plus only to then having to lug my suitcase 3 blocks down the street to a deli and back to pick up the keys there was a lame excuse that the house keeper was supposed to be there to greet me but had to leave The deli guy seemed rather familiar with the keys and what to do with them The place itself is old and shabby and clearly no one lives there The art gives it a nice touch and the bed has a good mattress however yes the walls are thin and the neighbors fight a lot earplugs the curtains are flimsy sleeping mask the toaster oven is greasy half of the two plates and two cups are chipped the shower rod fell down on me the first time I drew the shower curtain the toilet seat still isn t fixed the chest of drawers is missing a chunk of wood etc all things that could easily be changed to make guests feel more welcome My impression is that Juan just doesn t care If you don t care either then this place is fine I for one will look for another place to stay and give my business to someone else the next time I m in New York'
p488
S'Juan s place was easy to locate and very close to public transportation It was a very good deal and located in what felt like a safe neighbourhood The accommodation itself was comfortable and much more spacious than I was expecting Basic linens were provided however we purchased our own handsoap for the bathroom Communication ahead of time was less than ideal I arrived at the location without having received communication from Juan despite repeated attempts It was quickly sorted out and did not hinder our stay'

S'I really wanted to like this place the location was great the price was reasonable BUT the place was falling apart there is a ton of water damage in the bathroom Peices of the ceiling where falling on me as i showered The shower curtain rod is anchored to a wall that has turned to mush from water damage and falls out of said wall and onto you in the shower if you so much as graze it The toilet sprays water on you when you flush it The cable didnt work so forget about watching tv The apartment was somewhat clean but still felt like i was stepping around a dirty hostil The kitchen was sticky everywhere like someone had been frying cuchifritos non stop for a decade and there where little bits of food stuck everywhere so yeah prrreeeetty much gross The pictures you see hanging on the walls in the ad are all still there except they too are somehow sad to be in this place because they are dirty and now falling apart the one in the bathroom had the rear frame backing falling out of it This does not appear to be someones home it appears to be an air bnb business There was no toilet paper or soap in the place No rod to hang a towel up in the bathroom Also in the bedroom there was an unused yet opened condom a tube of lotion and a couple of ibuprofen Seriously WTF This place at one point had potential Now there is no way that i could ever recommend it or in all good conceus not warn others about the experience'

S'Juan s place was great for our extra long weekend stay in Brooklyn The location is great 5 min walk to the subway to go into Manhattan 10 min walk to trendy Bedford Ave where you will find bars restaurants shopping The apartment is a good size comfortable and fully private It s not luxury but if your looking for a private space at a great price this is it Also check in and out was really easy making our stay in Brooklyn a great experience'
p491
S'The location is perfect for those who love Brooklyn or what to experience New York like a local would do it There are many metro stations and buses available or you can enjoy a nice 15 minutes walk to get to the heart of Williamsburg Great restaurants just few blocks away and a big Walgreen right around the corner The apartment is super clean and comfortable good size for three people which is pretty hard to find in NYC Juan was great at communicating with us and always super helpful and responsive It was my parents first time using Airbnb they are 60 and they LOVED IT Thank you so much'

S'Juan was very welcoming and quickly answered messages about questions I had about the area The area is a few blocks away from trendy restaurants and the subway The subway was fairly easy to navigate and fast to get to the Manhattan area I wouldn t walk around alone in this area at night but felt perfectly safe during the day The location has all of the basics that you would need for your stay and it was very clean'

S'This apartment is described as Beautiful It is NOT It is in an interesting area if the price is right for you and you re not concerned about cleanliness then fine But otherwise don t just read my review look back at earlier ones which pick up the same faults as we do Reviews that praise the place unreservedly are suspect they were the ones that led us to choose it a definite mistake for us I m sure that someone comes in to clean superficially before each let kitchen surfaces utensils etc were fine But the apartment is shabby and very very grubby It has not been properly maintained or deeply cleaned for years and that shows The blanket on the main bed was marked and stained Pillows were stained and dirty inside The bath drain was desperately slow And I could go on We have plenty of photographs to illustrate all of this happy to send to you AirBnB just ask We had no problems with Juan himself communication which was very limited was OK arrangements for access were a bit strange but did work well for us We did not experience the serious noise problems others have mentioned there were sounds from nearby apartments during the night but not enough to disturb our sleep Decide based on what s important to you at the price If AirB B read this they should investigate themselves please People should be grossly misled by apartment descriptions'

S'This place was conveniently located in Williamsburg just a short ride to Manhattan It s cozy and affordable for a location so close to the city Although the space was good enough for my friends and I to just drop our things and explore the city the place was shabby We had no squeaky clean linens or blankets to sleep with the furniture and couches were mostly stained and it just looked unclean Clearly the place looks like it needs a really deep cleaning the washroom was abysmal and probably the upside to this place was the location Juan is a very nice host and courteous but if he invested a little more in the maintenance of his place my review of it would be much better I don t mean to sound high maintenance but a clean Airbnb is important all in all the place was just ok'
p495
S'Juan has been a very attentive host he let us make an early check in Tthough there are many things that can be improved in the house such as the shower cleanliness or the equipment of the kitchen the location of the apartment is very convinient and we had a very nice time in there Thank you Juan'

S'The location of the apartment is perfect You re in the middle of a hot spot in Brooklyn and have easy access to main subway lines as well as being at walk distance from many important Brooklyn spots The apartment is what you need to live a local experience with all the comfort that you need You need good food 5 minutes walk You need good music 5 minutes walk You need a taxi to drive you home They know the place as it s a major spot in Brooklyn I definitely recommend this place to easy going people that don t care about high comfort level but wanna see how the real Brooklyn is'
p497
S'Apartment is good for the price Expectations could have been a little clearer we dropped bags off at 3pm waited for apartment to be cleaned at 6pm then received a text at 9am the following morn to say new guests were arriving and how soon could we leave This is a fine place to crash for a night if you have biz in the city centrally located cute apartment'

S'Great experience with Juan s apartment The location is really convenient close to the subway 5 10min with direct line to Manhattan Williamsburg is also a very charming locations lots of small shops and restaurants We forgot that we were in New York Juan was very helpful We had no issue overall Concerning the apartment by itself convenient for 2 3 people overall OK even if the state of the bathroom could be improved'

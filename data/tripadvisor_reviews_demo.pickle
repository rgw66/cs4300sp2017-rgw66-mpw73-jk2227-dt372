VIf the location works for you (it did for me when I had a nearby business event), this is an excellent hotel. The hotel is modern and welcoming. The service is competent. The highlights were the views from my room of the Hudson river and the USS Intrepid and the wonderful bar on the top floor.

VDuring a business trip I stayed here for 5 nights. It is a great hotel, beautiful from the outside as well as from the inside. Nice room, with a very old feel, but with modern day comfort: a large, very soft bed, and a Bluetooth loudspeaker to hook your smart phone or computer to, amongst the many amenities (free Wi-Fi! No password!). My room was facing the courtyard (and terrace), which was really very quiet, probably because of the winter cold, but the streets surrounding the hotel weren't too busy either.\u000aThe only downside to the High Line Hotel is the lack of a restaurant. There is a coffee counter, very posh and stylish, with all the right coffees for hipsters and such, but not the place for me to eat my breakfast, continental or not. There is no room service either. Breakfast, lunch and dinner should be had somewhere else, which is okay if you wanted to explore the city anyway.\u000aI didn't hear my neighbors, but maybe there weren't any. So, apart from the jetlag, I could sleep well.

VHotel Chandler is a good deal considering its price and location. It is located at the 31st and 5th and close to underground stations on 36th and 28th. You can take a short walk to Times Square or a longer walk to Central Park to stretch your legs. The hotel itself is rather chic and has a great lobby with free coffee and tea service all around day. Another positive side of the hotel is the staff. They are attentive and polite. Housekeeper not only made our bed impeccably each day but also she came in each night when we were out and folded the bedspread and left a piece of chocolate. Nice touch!\u000aHowever, this hotel has also some downsides. No matter how attentive and polite were the staff they were unable to solve the shower leak problem in our room. We stayed 11 nights and during the whole stay we used the foot towel to sweep the bathroom ground after taking a shower. Another downside was the aircon. It was so noisy when running and on top of this it broke down in the middle of a freezing NYC night. Hotel staff managed to provide an electrical heater which was far less noisy and efficient than the aircon. Kudos to the staff once again. Breakfast was not included in our rate so first day we had our breakfast in Juni restaurant which was a total rip-off. We never went there again after we discovered Bread and Butter around the corner. You can have far better breakfast there for one fifth price of Juni.\u000aThe last point that is worth mentioning is that there is a construction work going on across the street. Expect high noise levels between 08-23 hrs. The construction was in the beginning phase as of Nov 2014. Opting for a lower floor might be better during this time as higher floors are directly exposed to noise source.\u000aDespite all the downsides, considering the rate and the service quality i would strongly recommend this hotel.

VStayed five nights and were very dissapointed with the overall experience. The rates charged position the Hotel as a top class hotel and the only thing that justifies these rates is the staff who are mostly doing their best to be helpful and attend to your needs. Everything else was not at par with what you would expect in Manhatten at this level. The room ( we took the Deluxe!) was very small and poorly furinished, the bathroom tiny and very basic and the worst was the terrible noise form the street . The windows are old and do not isolate noise nor cold which means that you get noise both from the street and from the heating system that blows all night with a lot of noise.\u000aWe were moved, at our request from the forth to the seventh floor but that did not improve anything.\u000aAdd to this very long waits for elevator, breakfast that is not good and too expensive and we definitely are not coming back!

VI've stayed here several times for business. The upper East Side location was a little inconvenient for a rash of mid-town and downtown meetings, but the trade-off was having a different kind of experience. There's a more personal and relaxed feel here that is missing in the typical high-end business-oriented properties. Staff is friendly. Rooms have tons of great amenities, including extra walk-in closets off the bathroom and vanishing TVs in the over-sink mirrors... great for bath time! Glass ceiling in the restaurant makes breakfast very pleasant. Smallish in feel, in the New York way.

VThis boutique hotel was perfect for our honeymoon. It's a great choice for those familiar with the city and equally great for a first time visitor, due largely to its location (one block - or less - from several subway lines, Central Park, Zabar's, and all the restuarant choices (via Columbus Ave) one could ever hope for). The staff go out of their way to make everything flawless, super super clean and elegant (feels like a pricier hotel than it actually is) and much more personal than the bigger establishments, in which you feel anonymous or could get lost in the crowd of tourists. For the price, you'll just not do better. That's a fact. But spending a bit more (which I've done) you probably won't get better either. Decor, gym, staff, cleanliness, elegance, personal attention - I can't think of anything that one would change if they could. As a former New Yorker and (now) frequent NYC visitor, it's my favorite spot. Going back in a few weeks and I can't wait.

VMy husband and I stayed here in mid December. I read the reviews before I booked but I decided to make my own mind up about the place because the location was ideal for what we came to NYC for (Christmas shopping and Christmas Lights) and the price was great.\u000aI'm so glad I took the chance because we loved this hotel. Yes, the lobby is tiny but all we did in the lobby was check in and pick up free coffee which was available anytime we wanted it (absolutely perfect for December in NYC). Yes, we giggled a bit when we opened the door and saw how tiny the room was, but honestly, the space was well utilized and as it turned out, it was all the space we needed. The bed was really comfortable, the bathroom was super clean, there was a nice tv, free wifi and the staff was friendly.. What else do you need in a hotel room? We were rarely in it except for to sleep and get ready in the mornings.\u000aWe ate breakfast in the hotel our last day and it was a pleasant surprise. In fact, there was a pretty big selection. Eggs, sausage, cinnamon rolls, yogurt, cereal fruit, toast, bagels and pancakes from the pancake machine.\u000aWe've stayed in fancier hotels in NYC, but honestly, after this trip we decided this is our "go to" hotel now. For the price, it was perfect for us.

VA great hotel with authentic new york charm. First of all , Location is key. The hotel is ideally located blocks away from times square and central park. To add to the convenience,The subway is only 2 blocks away. Secondly, the staff are great.from the bell boy, front desk staff, house keeping staff , every1 were curteous and polite.Now the gorgeous rooms. The rooms were massive. They have to be one of the biggest rooms I have stayed in new York. The suite was fully equipped with a mini bar, coffee machine , 2 large queen size beds , a dining table , and a dressing table - everything you want and need. The buffet breakfast is a must try @ the hotel. The hotel also has a popular bar / restaurant which is always busy with trendy new yorkers.Thank you warwick for making my stay very very memorable.

The first nice surprise was the call a few minutes after we got into the room asking if we're OK with the room. It was very clear that if we had a complaint - they were there to listen and fix right away. The other great thing is the free 5-8pm coffee and snacks they have in the lobby. It\u2019s just great to come back from the city, just before leaving later for the rest of the evening adventures in NYC.

The hotel rooms are very well appointed, but keep in mind they are small: a boutique hotel right? Everyone was very attentive to our needs and quick to offer assistance.\u000aThere are many restaurants nearby that are great. The hotel does have a bar and restaurant. The restaurant does have a per-fix menu. We did not eat here because we already had reservations at other eateries prior to our arrival\u000aI highly recommend staying at the Algonquin especially if you will be in the mid-town area.

VIf you like hotels with an old feel with good service, this is a good option.\u000aStayed in a king deluxe suite - the room had a lot of nice old furniture, but is definitely "old" decor.. good size to the room, only real downside is the bathroom, which feels like "grandma's house" - small and in need of a refresh. However, if you're a fan of all the little bathroom goodies you used to find in hotels years ago (like the shoe mitt, shower cap, etc.) the Lucerne will not disappoint.. and this particular room (and many others) had a nice kitchenette area - very appreciated for family travel. Robes, umbrellas in room.\u000aService was excellent - very responsive staff\u000aPrice was a bit high compared to other options in the area, but with limited competition on the upper west side, they tend to get their price.\u000aWifi is atrocious. Was free, but was basically unusable and often disconnected itself.\u000aIf you are a visitor, I can think of better places to stay than the UWS, but if you need to be in the area (as we did), I would consider the Lucerne at the right price. Solid 4 star hotel (though old decor - this is not a trendy boutique hotel).

VWe usually stay closer to the Central Park area but decided to go a bit further South. What a great find! This hotel sits on the corner of Park Ave and 26th Street. Great location for walking to Union Square for the farmers market and restaurants, to Greenwich Village and neighborhoods. Went "uptown" one day and it was so much more crowded! Eataly, across from the Flat Iron building is just a few blocks away. ShakeShack in Madison Park is 2 blocks! We were upgraded to a beautiful corner suite with robes, 2 tvs, nice bar area, roomy bathroom with nice products. Most rooms have a balcony. Ours overlooked Park Ave. Staff was knowledgeable about what was going on in the area and were generally very friendly. The generous afternoon wine and cheese, with live piano music, saved us a bundle and the wine served was very good. Will definately return.

VStayed for 5 nights end of May/beginning of June. The only criticisms I can think of are that one of the lifts was out for one night, and the room was really noisy but street noise easily blocked out by air con fan. The hotel is amazing, lovely big rooms (superior) and even the mini doubles are big for NYC. The roof terrace has amazing views of Manhattan and the breakfasts are fantastic. After a long day sightseeing and a fab dinner it is wonderful to grab a free coffee from the lounge and head up to the roof terrace to see NYC by night. The hotel staff are great too, we called reception twice once where the safe was not working (our fault) and once to ask how to work the fan on the air con, both times the engineering guy was in our room within 5 minutes to help. The rooms are meticulously clean and the shower is great, wonderful water pressure, only thing missing is a bath.

VThe hotel was seconds from the subway which was 10 mins into time square and quite safe to use. There is a starbucks next door to the hotel. Check was very quick and the people very friendly and helpful. We were stranded in new york because of the volcano. We had 4 rooms. 310 and 311 which were quite from traffic noise but no hotel noise, 408 which had a window that looked onto a brick wall which if you put your arm out the window you could touch and 416 which felt like you were sleeping outside on the pavement. Sheets, towels and bathrooms spotless clean (we ususally stay in the Westin at time square and found the cleanliness on the same lines as there). Unfortunately the walls are paper thin and you could hear next door pulling their shower curtain. The hotel is very dark which was a little worrying as we wondered what it was hiding. The corridors are painted a darkish blue with terracota door frames and the lights have metal/bronze shades over them making the corridors extremely dark, the rooms are painted in these dark colours and they are also very dark. My children have stayed in many hostels on their trips and said it was like staying there but the linen was cleaner. The carpet was stripey and when you walk down the stairs you have to look hard as the stripes make it hard to see where the step ends and the next begins. There are no lifts but the guys there were more than happy to help my 70 year of in laws with their bags (we actually felt sorry for them and we all carried our bags). Reception staff were lovely but the two girls we met serving behind the bar was very ignorant and felt like they were doing you a huge favour in serving you. There is a housing project development behind the hotel and I would not suggest walking through there. We used the subway at all times of the day and even coming home one night at 1:30am and it was perfectly safe and quite crowded. In short I would not stay there again but once i got in my room and saw it was clean I breathed a sigh of relief. There were no funny smells either. My children said they would not mind staying there again although the location put them off, it was not a good area to be in.

VWhile the building itself is beautiful, the staff was rude and hateful. They also did not seem to have any idea what was happening with their rooms. Upon arrival at 4:40pm, we were told it would be about twenty minutes before our room was ready. An hour later we were told the guest in the room they put aside for us was staying extra nights and they were working on finding us another room. We had been traveling since 7am and really wanted to rest. We spoke with a manager who offered us two comp breakfast buffets for the room. I reminded her we had been waiting nearly two hours after check-in and still did not have a room and asked if that could be extended to include each of our three days' stay. She shouted that what she already offered was worth well over $100 and she was "not going to haggle." The breakfast buffet is $22pp. After getting an accessible room that we were not allowed to stay in a second night, we were sent to another room the second day. We opened the door to find other guests in the room. The next room offered had no space to stow our small carry-ons. We settled on a decently-sized room, and that manager offered us free wi-fi for the length of our stay. Attached are photos of the water closet, taken from the doorway. Literally, barely space to turn around (I tested it.) Notice the proximity of the radiator to the stool. Be prepared to sit sideways ;) The clothes closets were the same in each room we viewed...the only way to hang a single dress is to remove the ironing board. NYC hotel rooms can be small. If you need a little extra room for mobility, ask to see your room before accepting the key.

VI stayed at the Paramount Hotel from 11/11/13 \u2013 11/13/13. As soon as I walked into the hotel I received excellent customer service. The front lobby staff, I believe her name was Nathalie, was extremely professional and welcoming. She insured my luggage was stored while my room was made available. She called me and let me know that my room was ready, and upon my departure from the hotel made the check-out experience fast and easy so that I could catch my train. The storage room staff were also very professional as well.\u000aI felt the rooms were small, but had a nice cozy feel to it. The fitness room was sufficient for a hotel of its size, containing several cardio and weight lifting machines, and dumbbells. The hallways were fairly dark, and I felt they would do better to brighten them up. The bathroom tub in my room could have used a little upgrading. But the bathroom and the room itself were kept very clean. The cleaning staff did a great job with room cleanliness, towels, etc. Overall, the hotel has a comfortable, laid back, unpretentious feel to it.\u000aIn summary, I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely choose this hotel again during my next business trip to NY which will be very soon and often.

The location was perfect; close to Penn Station, Times Square, and many restaurants. The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff was pleasant. The breakfast was more than enough to get us started for the day. The room was on the small side, but that is normal for New York. The bathroom was very clean and actually very big for New York. The only problems were the water temp, hot hot at night and lukewarm in the morning, and the pillows were very small and uncomfortable, almost like airline pillows. One of the best parts of the hotel was the bellhop. He was charming and fast and stored our bags for the day and remembered which one it was without any prompt. I would stay here again, but bring my own pillow.

The price can be right too; we paid $320 (all in) per night, although prices vary. We're walkers, and so walking an hour to theater or other midtown venues is fine with us; anything to avoid staying midtown. Intelligentsia runs a fantastic espresso bar with really, really nice baristas in the lobby, and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (if you don't mind rubbing shoulders with a preponderance of small dogs). The good news is that you too can bring your dog for a sleepover if you so desire. Here are the downsides: 1) the lobby is downright cold because of the draft from the front doors. 2) The lighting in the room is too dim, especially in the bathroom. Unless you are about 18 years old and have excellent eyesight, I would not attempt to put make-up on in here. 3) The bathroom door gets in the way and if you want to dry your hair in front of the mirror, you will have a view of exactly half of your head. 4) This is most important to me: the bed is too, too soft. Even my husband, who can sleep, upright, through Armageddon, complained this morning that his back was sore. 5) The coffee bar is only open from 5-9 pm at night; I think it'd be nice to hang around for a drink after a show. 6) Only one ADA room and the outside courtyard (which beckons invitingly, were it warm outside) is not accessible. But, I must reiterate, the price, location and ambiance make this hotel completely worthwhile for a return trip, in my estimation. I would give it a 3 and 3/4 star if possible.

VI also booked through the internet, but I didn't notice a difference in attitude. The room was exactly as it appears on their site. I expected the room to be small, as it's New York and the hotel is over a century old. I didn't find it too small at all. I'm a light sleeper, but the radiator (which was not exactly quiet) didn't wake me up at all. Maybe it was because the beds are so comfortable. Hotel beds are always an issue for me because of back problems, but their beds were just as comfortable as mine--no small task. I was at a loss to discover no coffee in the room, but solved that dilemma with room service, which was very quick. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I felt very at home there. The location is very convenient--I walked everywhere. I thought the hotel was very charming and would recommend it to anyone, although if you're expecting it to be like a chain hotel, forget it. It's a famous, old hotel with great charm and a lot of history behind it.\u000a

VClose your eyes and picture yourself sitting on a worn overstuffed brown leather sofa drinking a Bourbon by a fireplace in a huge library adorned with comfy chairs, sultry lighting, great art books and light jazz in the background. You're home visiting your grandparents who used to run a business in this very location in this building but now has converted into a huge estate...they're Italien but have lived in Bali for the last 30 years and when in town live here. It's traditional Italian mixed with Asian minimalism. The furniture is comfy chic, the amenities are top level, the spa is Asian bohemian chic and quiet and discreet and fabulous, albeit expensive...We were in town for a ball. I like my autonomy, as do movie (pop) stars whom also stayed at this hotel which is why I was pleased to see they were not approached by any of the guests for autographs. It's quite unassuming. At first you see another warehouse converted into a boutique hotel but things then start to creep up on you, like the service...you can't tell who works there but someone is always around to help. I ordered the ravioli at the bar one night...the tomato sauce was out of this world, not particularly the flavour but that one could not detect any trace of acidity that most chefs have trouble balancing. My bed had feather mattresses and down pillows and free food, like Cracker Jacks and Twizzlers and cookies that they replenished daily. I personally loved the location, it was out of the bustle of the city therefore quiet. I slept like a baby.

VWe booked to go to New York for my boyfriend\u2019s 30th birthday in December, as it was a big birthday we wanted to book a really nice hotel and after much research we decided on this one.\u000aThis hotel was beyond perfect! The hotel is in a perfect location, it is right near the theatres and just 5 minutes from Time Square. We were able to walk to everything from our hotel and the only time we needed taxis was when we were going to the Statue of Liberty and to the Yankees Stadium. The hotel is spotless and the staff are very friendly especially the doormen!\u000aThe hotel rooms were lovely, very large and always clean. The hotel also arranged for a cake to be brought to our room after we had arrived. Our room was a King bed superior room and we were based on the 5th floor. We would have preferred to have been higher as you may have had more of a view but we weren't in there long enough to worry, we did have the typical New York view of a ballet class in the building opposite.\u000aNew York itself is just amazing especially at Christmas time, this was our first visit and we were lucky enough to have 2 snow storms. The shopping was great and there were lots of discount days because of the holidays, in Macys we received an extra 10% off as we were foreigners.\u000aWe did all the usual tourist stuff, my favourite was the Statue of Liberty, the Rockefeller Centre at night, the tree and the Empire State Building. We bought our tickets online beforehand and got some good deals, I would definitely recommend the que jumping tickets as you get to just walk in and avoid the massive ques! I would definitely recommend going to the Statue of Liberty early as it gets busy, we were on the 10.30 tour and we had to wait for over an hour out in the cold just to get into the security check, you have to do this twice! We also bought the tickets online for Rockefeller and upgraded to get the photos included, be aware it is not a printed photo! They will email you 2 of the photos that they take but they are not cropped so you have to do this yourself when you print them at home, the upgrade does give you discount to buy the photos at £15 whilst you are there if you want any printed. We also went to a Rangers game (ice hockey) at Madison Square Gardens which was well worth the money and we also did a tour of the Yankees stadium which was good.\u000aWe found quite a few nice places to have breakfast, there was a little café round the corner from the hotel called Westside dinner, it was so cheap and really good. We had lots of good evening meals but my favourite was Carmines just up from the hotel which was based on a mobsters Italian restaurant.\u000aWhen we went it was very cold (-11!) so you definitely needed layers and we were not prepared for how cold it actually was!\u000aOverall I couldn\u2019t recommend this holiday and hotel enough. When we go back to New York we will definitely stay here again!

VMy son and I had a fantastic stay at a Kimpton hotel in Philadelphia while looking at colleges, then, a couple of months ago my husband and I stayed in a sister hotel, the Muse, and had a wonderful stay. This trip I decided to try Ink 48.\u000aThe hotel is nicely renovated with spacious and light filled rooms. We were enthusiastically greeted and given some free minibar type amenities and a free bottle of wine. We were in room 1010, which has a view to the north along the river. That seemed fantastic, until about nine pm.\u000aOn the next block, on top of a short building, is a very popular, and very, very loud nightclub, with booming bass, screaming patrons, a constantly chattering very amplified DJ, and cars constantly honking in front of it. I asked the front desk what time the noise stopped and the response was 'Well, it's Friday. The weekend, you know." "Ok", I said, "do you have any rooms on the other side of the hotel?". Of course there were none available. I put in earplugs, hoping the fire alarm wouldn't go off, and I took two Benedryl. That wasn't enough. The front desk sent up a white noise machine. Now it sounded like I was in a disco at the seashore, which helped a little bit.\u000aI woke up in the morning and went down to eat breakfast. The restaurant for breakfast doesn't open until 9:30. I ate some oatmeal and tea hunched over a tiny drinks table in the area they have set up for "early" eaters.\u000aComing up in the elevator other people were talking about how they hoped they'd be able to sleep this evening. The hotel has noise machines to give people. This is clearly a problem. The hotel in the Air France terminal at CDG has glass that keeps the rooms silent as jumbo jets are landing just outside the windows. The Kimpton group should really look into that type of glass. This noise at Ink 48 in the rooms on the north side of the hotel is really not acceptable.\u000aNow it is midnight on Saturday. I have my earplugs, white noise machine ocean sounds, and took a benedryl, and was hoping to get some sleep. We'll see. Not sleeping well two nights in a row will make it easier to try to sleep on an overnight flight I have tomorrow, I suppose that is a positive.\u000aI like the Kimpton hotels, but I will not stay here again unless I can be guaranteed a south facing room.

VWe stayed here for 5 nights. This was our first time staying in the Upper West Side and the NYLO was a perfect choice. The location is fantastic, 2 blocks from the 79th street subway; walking distance to Central Park and shopping in the area (Century 21, Marshall's, DSW Shoes). Many options for dining within 2-3 blocks of the hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The standard room was small (ours was lacking additional space for a desk and chair), the bathroom was clean and functional with a large shower and good water pressure. The bed and pillows were extremely confortable and air-conditioning worked well. The room was very quiet, never heard a peep from other guests. Overall, except for the lack of additional seating, our stay at the NYLO was excellent. We will definitely return.

VMy husband (who is disabled) and I stayed at the Metro which was very clean and comfortable, the staff - on the fist day - a bit surly but then became friendly. However, I would like to make known some observations about the room we stayed in (Room 214). The actual bedroom and bathroom were very spacious indeed, particularly bearing in mind the average size of New York hotel rooms. There was plenty of room to move around in in the bedroom and the bathroom was large with handrails everywhere and a large seat from which you could shower. I would recommend one of these rooms. Unfortunatel there was not a safe in the room and, as this is a complementary item, they do not have to supply one, the clothes hanging space is a rail (no wardrobe) and at a good height for disabled people but if you have dresses that hang below the knee then b e prepared for them to drape on the floor. The mirrors in both bedroom and bathroom are set very high so take a free-standing mirror with you, especially if you cannot stand and want to put make-up on. There are two lifts, of which only one will take you to the roof terrace (Penthouse level) but from here you still have 4 steps to negotiate. Linens and towels are changed every day but unfortunately there is a two hour gap between collection and replacement. If you wanted to come back about mid-day to freshen up, no towels available, however if you are out all day, no problem.\u000aA word to smokers, although the hotel does not say it, it appears to be a non-smoking hotel (exception the roof terrace, in the open area which is very limited and in the sun virtually all day). If you do try to sneak a craftly one in the room by the window, they will catch you out and a $250 fine may be imposed (just so you know). I did not meet one holiday guest who had requested a smoking room in advance and actually got allocated one.\u000aAfter all this I would still recommend the hotel because, as said, its clean, good location, reasonably quiet although there is a small construction site out back but we did not have any problems with noise etc. I would consider selecting this hotel again but if another was available, would maybe choose that instead. One last thing, they do not stock the fridge with a mini-bar, they no longer do this.

VWe spent quite a bit of time deciding on which hotel to stay at for our week in New York and this hotel ticked all the boxes. Located between 5th and 6th avenue, with Macy's around the corner, the subway at the end of the block, Penn Station just five minutes walk away and Times Square just 10 minutes away this was the perfect location for us.\u000aUpon arrival we were told we had been upgraded from our Queen Premier room to a Suite, we couldn't have been more pleased, our room was located in the corner of the 11th floor with a view of the Empire State Building from the lounge and Herald Square from the bedroom.\u000aThe hotel is immaculately clean with one of the most comfiest beds we've ever slept in and with maid service everyday. The nice addition of a rooftop terrace means you can take food and drink up there to relax and take in the amazing views of the Empire State Building all lit up at night.\u000aThey have free wine tasting each night between 5pm and 6pm but unfortunately we couldn't make it just because of just how busy we were.\u000aThis is an amazing hotel and if you're looking to stay in Midtown then I cannot recommend highly enough, we will definitely be back again. Thank you to all the staff for making it a wonderful stay in New York.

You will not spend a lot of time in your room in New York! This is not the point in your visit, so don't go for expensive 5* hotels just to have a huge room! Go for the paramount with the best location a few minutes walk from TImes square and save your money for all of the amazing attractions, restaurants and shows that are on offer! The coffee shop is great and the staff were friendly and helpful. Use the luggage area for $2 per case of you have a later flight so that you can got out and enjoy the city in your last day!

VThis is my 3rd time to NYC but first time staying in the thick of it in Time Square. The Paramount had good prices in comparison to the reviews so we figured what the heck.\u000aWe booked a deluxe room with a king bed and were pleasantly surprised at the size for a NYC room which is typically quite small. We asked the front desk if there was a chance at an upgrade considering we were there for a mini honeymoon (wife wanted to see the rockefeller tree so this was a surprise trip for her), the lady at the front said she would upgrade us but to be honest I'm not sure anything was changed except that we had a corner room on the floor.\u000aNow I don't mean to nitpick but we did run into a few issues:\u000a- The TV would randomly turn on/off on its own. We had a tech come up twice and finally he replaced the whole TV with minimal issues, we were impressed with the service, he was extremely nice.\u000a- They don't give you enough towels, its a room for at least 2 people yet only 1 bath towel was in the room and we had to request more, again, small but still thought I'd mention it, since it was a hassle every day.\u000a- Lastly, the hotel is extremely dark, the elevators are almost pitch black and more often than not you get into the elevator from the main floor and someone pushes the wrong floor simply cause you can't see the numbers. I get that they're going for a cool modern look, but brighten up the place just a bit.\u000aOverall our experience was good. There are a ton of restaurants nearby, time square is literally out the front door. Don't waste you time or money eating in time square, walk over to hell's kitchen and enjoy the food there, so many restaurants to choose from and overall less crowded. The subway is accessible within a block or so in any direction but we walked almost everywhere, its New York, you gotta enjoy the sites!\u000aThe paramount is a good hotel, clean, right in the middle of the busiest part of NYC. The staff is friendly and the feel of the hotel is very pleasant. I'd stay there again for sure, but I'll bring my flashlight for the elevator.

VWe stayed in this hotel for one night only. The room was rather old fashioned in layout but acceptable. Our room was at the rear of the hotel. It overlooked the air conditioning plant which generated constant noise. The breakfast was awful. Help yourself to a very limited buffet with plastic cutlery and paper plates. Don't forget to clear your table. The hotel was well placed for Central Manhattan.\u000aIf you want to visit New York, a better alternative is to get a hotel or apartment in Jersey City. It is less expensive, less taxed, less crowded and gives spectacular views of NY. Go explore NY using the transport links into Manhattan with PATH rail. It is frequent, cheap and connecting to the subway system is straightforward.

VA few months back we were disgusted to check into a room here that had urine stains all over the toilet and weeks worth of dust everywhere. Housecleaning manager promptly came up to investigate and admitted that they were having problems with this one employee and witnessed an uncomfortable exchange between them. Apologetic but nonetheless a failure on her part too, not to inspect room before giving OK? Cleaned up room and appeased our uneasiness with a complimentary breakfast...OK we move on.\u000aHowever upon checking out of our room, my wife and I do a clean sweep. We check under the bed and could not believe what we saw and how we failed our child. I must have counted at least half a dozen nuts among other things. Now you see the problem here is... my son is severely anaphylactic to nuts. Having played with his cars during stay and one of them mistakingly gone under the bed's edge and reached to find it... a tragedy could of ensued by just touching one of them. We were furious and explained situation at front desk. Everyone concerned and shocked at my pictures that I had taken. Was told Hotel manager will contact you at home. Left very disappointed.\u000aHere is where things get interesting. Hotel Manager calls and politely attempts to make amends as I divulge I have stayed here numerous times and given you rave reviews but this time around we were appalled. Perhaps attempting to avoid a bad review he makes a peace offering." Please give us another chance and here is my number and I will personally take great care of you next time around". I wondered how...considering my son was unknowingly a foot away near death during entire stay. " Don't worry just call me."\u000aSo here we are, I take him up on his offer recently. I do call and guess what? To my surprise he gives me a wrong number. OK. Nonetheless I track him down and call him at hotel and drop him a message... that was never returned. OK... I am still coming. Inquired daily during stay to let him know we were there. Told he was in a meeting constantly. For all 3 days? I give up.\u000aBottom line. Never even had the decency to call us up in our room let alone come see us or offer anything. He did have another manager call to say " I am aware of your past stay but we believe it was dealt with,correct."... Flabbergasted...Made to feel like a nuisance too. So in conclusion, Thanks Hotel Manager for taking great care of us this time around...wink wink, and putting such little value on my boys wellbeing. He would have loved to have met you.

My walk to school was amazing everyday, walking through Times Square and feeling all the energy of the city. The hotel lobby was really nice inside( kinda "swanky"). They booked us a handicap room which I thought was nice of them because I didn't request one. It gave us a little more room in the room since they are usually the size of a shoe box. Bathroom was big, closet space was small but overall it was fine for my husband and I. The bed situation wasn't ideal (it was a double bed) but your never really in your room anyway. downstairs was a really good coffee shop with pastries and snacks. There is also a pizza place right next door which was hands down the best pizza I ever had. I would definitely stay at the paramount again!

Hotel was very clean, staff were excellent apart from one young lady on reception, not naming names but you'll know who I mean if you have any dealings with her !! We found the breakfast to be filling and of high quality, yes the breakfast room did get a little busy at times but it wasn't a problem. Our only problem was the street noise during the night, we were at the front, a building across the street is being renovated & the giant skip(dumpster) is emptied between 3& 4 in the morning, we asked to move to a room at the back after 3 nights, fantastic, no noise & a good nights sleep. If you are booked to stay at the Metro soon I would recommend contacting them beforehand to request a room at the back. All in all a great hotel, would stay there again.

VI stayed here for for 4 days. The hotel is located one large block from times square and all of the broadway thwarted so it is perfect for first time visitors to NYC. Also for the adventurous, the hotel is located directly on top of a subway stop. There lobby is almost completely empty with no furniture or personality- do not recommend meeting friends there. Staff seemed overworked, always a line at the front desk, and on my departure on a Friday morning getting a bell hop to check in my luggage for a few hours took a full 20 minutes due to the crowds.\u000aMy tiny $650 a night room was underwhelming. There were no views of the Hudson or times square to be had--I could have been in any metro area. The room featured an in-room coffee maker; however, coffee for it was never replenished after I used it once. Also. they never bothered to give you additional toiletries either. These oversights and always being put on hold when calling the front desk really made me feel less than happy with my experience at the intercontinental. This is a generic hotel run by overworked robots. I'd send my friends to the The Muse hotel or the W for this kind of cash. And oh, did I mention they charge $16 a day for wifi?

VI was completely satisfied with this hotel for what it is. It's a tourist hotel, not a luxury hotel, so it's functional but not amazing. I stayed in a room with a queen-size bed which also had a desk, decent bathroom and good closet space. The only minor feature of the room I did not like was the cheap tissues, which were rough and uncomfortable, but of course it's not hard to buy your own. The room was clean and comfortable, decent size by NYC standards, and the hotel is well located. They offer breakfast but I prefer the Bread & Butter at the corner of 29th and Park. All in all, a fully satisfactory experience. I'll be back.

VWe selected this hotel based on other reviews and the fact that they do not charge a resort fee, there was free wifi and breakfast and we could get a two room family room. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to the 8th floor. Nice! Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom amenities top notch. Great location near Macy's and Times Square so we could walk to sites. The breakfast buffet of coffee, cold cereal, yogurts and pastries was quick and adequate before heading out for the day. All the staff was incredibly polite and professional. We would have given the hotel 5 stars if not for a plumbing issue throughout our 4 night stay. Our toilet continually plugged requiring maintenance each day. The hotel was very apologetic and offered to change our room on the 3rd night, however we declined given that we were checking out the next day. We received a credit on our bill which was appreciated. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.

VI've stayed here occassionally over the last 45 years, initially charmed by its theatrical history (I once sat next to Stephen Sondheim!). There are few left who remember the Round Table or its members, so now it's left to its own devices. Plusses: Close to Times Square and theatres; First rate finishing and maintenance of the rooms; Food (just breakfast) is okay but NYC prices. Negatives: Rooms are very quirky, which in some cases is charming and in some annoying ( z.b. I had a room 2nd floor front where the windows looked out on the underside of awnings and the bath was two steps up and a miracle of miniaturization ); Service was not bad, just indifferent; The lobby is a jumble of unmatched pillars (probably unavoidable), harsh halogen sconces and chandeliers, and an excess of furniture that looks like a garage sale. I am a great fan of Marriott, this is the third one I've stayed at in three weeks. But to be in the Autograph Collection it needs some work.

VStayed for one night before a business meeting at the Penn Plaza nearby. Since we took the red-eye to NY we got to the hotel before 6:00am and still got checked in right away. The room was spacey enough for my needs and the space was efficiently used. The room has a desk which I used for doing some work and the shower was large enough to contain a bathtub (although it didn't). Breakfast was good and contains several hot and cold items - Pretty much the stuff you would normally pay for in an actual Marriott, the only difference is the usage of disposable utensils instead of china. The lobby is good enough as a staging area before going to the city, not really suitable for any business meeting or for working. For a price of 139$/night (around 160$ inc. taxes) I couldn't ask for more in NY. They also offered an advanced booking rate (non-refundable) for 109$ before taxes.

VThe Mark is the trendiest hotel in town, this is where the Upper East Side crowd gather for a late dinner at Jean-Georges. Menu is french, sometimes italian and slightly Americanized. It's made to appeal the regulars who seek comfort food such as, Pizza, Pasta and Burgers. I would suggest to skip the breakfast which is nothing special, I would also note, unrefined..\u000aThe Mark is comparable to The Greenwich Hotel or The Gramercy Park. Hotel staff is friendly and service is personalized. The rooms, spacious will live up to your expectations, reminiscing of Paris' 16th Arrondissement, the decor is luxurious, colored in beige shades and pastels. The bathroom features a deep tub, a large shower and Art Deco black and white marble floor. Perfectly located on the 77th on Madison, you can spend the whole afternoon shopping, dining at Daniel and going back feeling right at home in your Madison One-Bedroom Suite. Enjoy.

VAmazing location! The hotel is located just at the edge of Times Square and Broadway. Fifth avenue is a few minutes in the opposite direction. All the main attractions are within easy walking distance. The concierge was very helpful, providing us with a map and suggested routes.\u000aWe received a very friendly welcome on arrival and were directed by the concierge to the reception desk right at the bottom of the lobby. The check in was basic, but efficient. We hadn't booked breakfast but after being quoted $44 per person by the receptionist, she then advised us that we could sign up to the Leaders Club programme and receive complimentary buffet breakfast for the duration of our stay.\u000aThe room ( a family room with two large beds for four people) was spacious, modern with a fantastic shower room (no bath).\u000aThe bedroom however lacked storage space. A small hanging rail and three slim wardrobe drawers with a further three small desk drawers. Not adequate for more than an overnight stay with four people.\u000aA further disappointment was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room.\u000aThe buffet breakfast was excellent. A good selection of hot and cold items including fresh pastries and deliciously fresh fruit. All the staff were extremely polite and helpful.\u000aI would definitely recommend this hotel due to its location, helpful staff and amenities.

The Tuscany provided a very large room (more like a suite) with a large bathroom, hot shower with lots of water, walk-in closet, and all of the normal amenities. We had cocktails in the bar "Audrey" twice, and the service was very good, and they offer 2:1 Mondays and Tuesdays. We needed to be in the area of Grand Central Station, and it's only a few blocks away. I highly recommend the Tuscany and so did the guy I was traveling with.

For the volume of rooms which they have the lifts are inadequate. They cannot cater for the number of guests staying in the hotel. 25 minute wait for a lift we could get into every morning. Myself and my brother took the stairs a lot which were more for staff usage by the looks of it but this was not an option for my mother who relied on the use of the lift.

WE made the pre check in and the reservations months before! After show the reservation they just said they have rooms in different floors and we needed to wait more time, no other solutions.

VI read a previous reviewers comments before I booked my reservation at the Greenwich Hotel...and he said "...if you enjoy charming places with lots of character, just book it..." I trusted the review and did as he said. I am so glad that I did.\u000aThe entire staff at the Greenwich Hotel is simply lovely. Every single employee was upbeat, friendly, personable and helpful.\u000aThe hotel design, layout, furnishings, private and comfy spaces were masterful. The rustic wood wainscoting in the hallways and ceiling beams reminded me of a retreat in the Australian outback called Burrawang West (check it out). These rustic details mixed with the warm colors and furnishings were so inviting...\u000aI recommend a work-out in the well appointed gym in the morning, followed by breakfast either in the library or outside in the courtyard. The hotel homemade granola mixed with yogurt and berries is delicious!\u000aIf this is a VIP location, I didn't notice it, and the clientele did not exude self-importance. I actually felt comfortable, as I do in countries outside the United States, saying good morning to my fellow guests as I entered the library in the morning. It's that kind of place. I did wonder if the woman on the cell phone as I was checking out was Meg Ryan, or did she just look like her...\u000aOh, and I slept really well...no honking horns as I have experienced in uptown hotels.

VJust had another great stay at Hotel Giraffe. It has become my favorite spot for a getaway weekend in Manhattan. There are a number of great restaurants nearby and several different subway lines are just a short walk away. I booked a King Suite for two nights recently. The first suite they put me in was on a low floor with little natural light, so I asked for a move, which they readily accommodated. I ended up with a suite overlooking Park Avenue that was filled with sun. Let me tell you what I love about this hotel. The staff is friendly and customer oriented, from the reception desk, to the door man, to the folks manning the breakfast counter. They really could not have been more helpful. The suites are well laid out with all the amenities one could need. I especially appreciate the empty fridge instead of one of those minibars that seem to charge you for opening them. The fridge easily held some sodas, fruit and a bottle of wine. The room rates include a very nice continental breakfast in the lobby, with real NY bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, coffee, tea and juice. The women working the breakfast will prepare your coffee or tea, toast your bagels, etc and bring it to your table. It's really very relaxing to sit with the morning's newspaper (available free in the lobby) a cup of coffee and some breakfast. The coffee and tea are available all day long accompanied by cookies. Every evening there's a wine and cheese reception, which is a great way to start the evening off. What's a review without a quibble or two, but they're both minor. In the first room I had the living room TV was hi-def, while the bedroom set was a flat screen hooked to a low def box. In the second room they were both hi-def. A channel guide would also have been very helpful. In the first room I just could not get the room warm enough. It was the coldest day in NY in years, so I expect it would have been fine any other day. Overall I was glad to be back at the Giraffe and I look forward to returning.

I left a necklace in the hotel safe and they were so good about arranging it's safe return to me. We got engaged in NYC and stayed in hotel 2 years ago so we when we decided to return for a late honeymoon the only hotel we had in mind was Giraffe. Looked at other places but knew we'd always compare to Giraffe and it's simply unbeatable. On our arrival the manager sent up a lovely bottle of Prosecco as a wedding gift. We are going to return again in Sept (fingers crossed) and hope Giraffe has availability given the fact it's becoming so well known & popular!!!!

VThe hotel is very conveniently located for visiting New York, however, it is getting old. The carpets in the corridors are not very clean but the room was clean and cleaned daily. The staff are not friendly or helpful. Try to ask a question and you get. "I haven't finished yet wait!!!" to quote MariaB at the desk.\u000aIf the room you get is not what you booked complain and eventually you might get it.\u000aFor breakfast, lunch and dinner I recommend Andrew's coffee shop about 100m towards Time's square. We were there for 4 days and only once got a friendly staff response.\u000aAbsolutely crowded. There were times you had to wait to get to the main entrance.\u000aThis was our first introduction to New York not a great start.

VMy husband and I stayed here 2 nights in july. The decor in the place is cool and has a bit of a rocker vibe. But the whole place is pretty small and tight. Our room was very small and yes I know we are in NYC but i had just stayed earlier that week at the Hilton Garden Inn on 54th and 8th and that place was bigger! Anyways the dark grey stone in the bathroom does not make me feel like it is clean..the beds were comfy but for two of us we have to squeeze by each other to go to the bathroom. So basically of you are not on the bed u are in way. They have k-cup coffee makers in the room so that was great. The hotel is attached to Serefina's Italian restaurant and the food there is great!. On the up side the upper west side neighborhood is a great "quiet" place. Plenty of shopping a few blocks away and most importantly Central Park is close by and you end up kind of in the middle and can walk straight across CP and get to the MET quite easily.

VI spent 2 days in this hotel, travelling for business. I appreciated the location, a couple of good restaurants nearby, the design and decoration of the rooms is very pleasant. The price is reasonnable for NY. All the staff at the desk are not very helpful (we needed to extend the stay for 1 night, we had to do it on line...). Except this small issue, everything was very good.

VTo say I loved this hotel would be an understatement. The city view from our room, floor 12, took my breath away and I spent quite a few hours just looking out the window (some of these were spent in the bath which is huge & inside the room for peak city viewing whilst relaxing). The space in the rooms is generous, especially for NYC. The furnishings are stylish & sumptuous. We found the staff to be friendly & polite. The lady at reservations, Lulu Elkerm, went out of her way to accommodate me and we even had a little gift for our anniversary from the hotel. There are some cute touches in the lobby such as water for dogs and flavoured waters in large mason containers for us humans too.\u000aAs far as location the hotel it's a bit out of the way of what some people would want to be near like fifth avenue or empire state building but was perfect for us as it's right next to the Hudson running path, close to the plethora of restaurants around Hell's Kitchen 46th 8th/9th. You can walk to Broadway in about 15 minutes and up to central park in 30. Be sure to check out the Press Room for cocktails, an exceptional view of the city from the roof and some delicious food.\u000aThis was my first experience of a Kimpton hotel and by these standards they will be a first choice for me in the future.

VThe Chelsea location is lovely, within walking distance of sundry independent shops and interesting restaurants not to mention the eponymous park, right on the doorstep. I0th is pretty busy, but we didn't hear much in our dual aspect roof room. The room was spacious, no dreaded fitted carpet, and well lit by secondary light sources; it felt individual. The bed was wonderful. But, good luck with getting any ice- cold water from the taps - in fact the plumbing was a little off; perhaps this is just par for the course in NYC...- our bathroom shower malfunctioned one morning, with some distinctly brackish water pouring from the taps. Here the lack of reception was a minor annoyance, and nothing was ventured to us by way of apology for the minor inconvenience of having to wait for our morning showers. Being Brits, we didn't push it.\u000aThe coffee's great and the terrace at ground floor to 10th is a very nice place to enjoy one, or a glass of chilled white.\u000aOverall, we loved it and we'd both be thrilled to stay here on our return to the city.

VHad some time to kill and made a quick (2day) trip to NYC to meet some friends and site-see. I've been to NYC many times but hard to get one of my usual favorites so chose the Hyatt Union Sq and was not disappointed. Staff was extremely friendly, hotel was clean and my loft room was large and extremely comfortable. And despite being a major chain the hotel had a slight boutique feel and was not massive, with is my preference. And Union Square is a great location with easy access to the major subway lines. Did not eat there but friends had dinner and stated excellent.

VStayed here for a 4 night visit to NY to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Check in was swift probably helped as we arrived late evening. On reaching our room we were delighted to find a handwritten card and bottle of bubbly from the manager. This was such a lovely surprise and totally unexpected. The room itself was large enough and included a refrigerator which was also very handy. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was well apportioned with the usual toiletries. The view from the bedroom window was not great but no more than we expected so not a problem. However, when we went to the roof terrace we were greeted with the most fabulous, uninterrupted view of the Empire State Building - such a treat (you can tell we were 1st timers to NYC!). Breakfast was fairly busy and we did have a little difficulty finding a table on the first morning but you soon realise that everyone is keen to get out and about so the tables soon become free. Good selection of pastries, bread, fruit etc - disposable tableware used but we were just happy to grab something before our sightseeing started.\u000aAnother big plus to this hotel was the complimentary wine tasting offered by the hotel every evening - superb!\u000aGreat location - apart from the ESB also just up the street from Macys, central Times Square walkable in 20mins. Plenty of bars and restaurants close to the hotel.\u000aWould happily stay here for our next trip.

VYou are going to love this hotel for so many reasons. Chief among them is the welcoming, helpful, knowledge staff. Let them guide you to restaurants and services, rely on them you won't be disappointed. The rooms were a nice size and so was the bathroom. Well appointed with your choice of pillows and mattress topper if you want. We were very satisfied with the continental breakfast it was ample and kept us going till dinner. Since we were visiting during the recent polar vortex we appreciated the hot chocolate and coffee after a day of being outside. We could relax with a hot drink and read the New York Times or Wall St. Journal in their comfy nicely furnished lobby, it became our late afternoon living room. We will definitely stay here again and would look forward to trying more hotels in The Library Collection. We were here 5 nights.

VExcellent stay at the Metro - ideal location for the first time visitor. Loved the roof top terrace and the view from our window of the Empire State. The photos on the hotel website do it justice.\u000aBreakfast ok considering included in price - lots of bagels, muffins, bread, cereal etc.\u000aVery hot weather when we were there and we had to have the air con on constantly which was a little noisy - but then so is NYC!\u000aSubway within very short distance. Macy's, Times Square, NY Public Library, Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station and obviously Empire State all within easy walking distance.\u000aBrendans Restaurant across the road a bit pricey compared to a lot of other places we ate but ok for first night if you're as tired as we were. Also recommend Playwrites Bar a couple of doors down, and the Heartlands Brewery at the Empire State Building if you want to sample some good local beers. If you feel like splashing out go to the Rainbow Grill in the Rockerfeller Centre for a champagne cocktail and relish the lovely evening views.

VWe have a son who lives in NY and he requested that we stay on the Upper West Side so that we were close to where he lives. We chose NYLO. It was a reasonable price. We had read the rooms were small-ish but we didn't mind that. We had 3 people in our room (parents, one 16-year old) and although it was small it was nice and we were comfortable. We were 2 blocks from the 1 Train, which made it easy to go to Midtown as well as to our son's apartment. The hotel is clean. The concierge was helpful. The bar and sitting area was especially nice because it was cold outside and we did sit and use those. Also there are 2 restaurants attached to the hotel, which is very convenient. There is a CVS across the street. The beds were a little too soft, which made my back hurt, but it's hard to complain about a soft bed. It is noisy when emergency vehicles go by, which seemed kind of often, but you don't get street noise. It was convenient, clean and we enjoyed staying there.

VThis was our first trip to NY and we wanted a hotel within walking distance to Penn Station, as we were planning to use New Jersey Transit to connect from Newark International Airport to Penn Station. We ended up choosing this hotel despite the mixed reviews posted at the time of booking and we were happy we did. This was literally across from Penn Station. Couldn't have been more convenient!\u000aPenn Station is a greaet subway station with many lines passing through so you are within 30-40 minutes of anywhere you would like to go. The hotel is also within reasonable walking distance(30-45 minutes) to many attractions such as Times Square, The High Line, The Museum of Modern Arts, Rockefeller Centre, Radio City Music Hall and Grand Central Station, etc... There are also lots of shopping and dining options nearby on 6th avenue 7th and 8th avenue. It is also just 25 minutes from Newark.\u000aCheck in by Omari was smooth and fast. Rooms are very good size with a kitchenette (a nice plus). The kitchenette had all you needed to make your stay comfortable: teapot, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, plates, glasses, mugs and cutlery. Beds are very comfortable and extra pillows ordered were promptly provided. Air Condition worked fine in our room. Wifi was included in our room rate and worked fine.\u000aThe lobby is renovated and the rooms refurbished. It is an older building and yes, the bathroom is small. But it is clean and this is really all you need. Staff was always friendly. The small convenience store near front desk was very handy.\u000aWe arrived late at night and noticed loud noises around midnight (as if someone is pulling furniture above you) that we thought were caused by the people in the room above us. We called front desk to complain and were told that they would send security up. This kept happening and after a few calls and a lot of frustration, we eventually fell asleep from fatigue. The next day, we woke up to the same noise at 6 am. This is when we realized that it was due to the elevators right beside the room. I checked with front desk and was told that most of the rooms with 2 beds (room numbers ending with 25) were located near the elevators . We asked to be transferred to a different room. Lisseth informed us that there would be one available at noon. We asked to check it before packing and moving into it to make sure it had the same features as our current room and was in fact away from the elevators. The alternate room was on the same floor which made the switch quite easy.\u000aI was concerned about the outside traffic noise based on the reviews I read but this was not as bad as I thought it would be. You are in a big city after all! We had the window open slightly at night and sirens and traffic noise didn't prevent us from sleeping.\u000aWe couldn't have chosen a better hotel for experiencing NY for the first time and would recommend it and stay there again. But we will be sure to ask for a room far from the elevator shaft.

VWe just spent a week in room 405 which is a double room. At first glance the hotel room is ok, but nothing special, but as others have stated it is so cosy, very clean and just so weel thought trough that it really grow on you, and we came to love getting back to the room every day.\u000aHaving the french balcony was a real plus as the good weather would make it possible to have them open when we got home and added to the charm.\u000aThe breakfast was just was we needed, and I must say that they really prioritizes quality over quantity. The bakery items was really really good and the coffee/espresso machine made really good latte.\u000aWe did not attend the evening sessions very often, but when we did we were surprised aging by the selection og cheeses as they were always very good and perfectly tempered.\u000aWhat stands out is the persons working at the hotel. Every single one made us feel like valued guests. I have never in any 5 star hotel experienced the consistant level of kindness and service we recieved every single day at hotel Giraffe.\u000aThere is no doubt that when ever we return to NYC this hotel will be our only choice going forward.

VThis hotel was 5 star in all aspects. It was 'reassuringly expensive' to say the least but worth every penny-even the extra pennies for a panoramic city view. The staff are immaculate and polite and charming and the service excellent, despite our room not being cleaned on one occasion-but this was rectified with immediate effect.\u000aThe rooms are gorgeous, and sizeable-exactly as depicted on website. It really is a rather amazing experience being able to have a bath whilst looking out at the city view.\u000aThe location is good as well, only about 10 mins walk from Times Square.\u000aLastly, the rooftop bar has amazing views and gets filled with New Yorkers, in addition to the hotel residents, in the evening. A great place for having a drink and people watching or listening before dinner.\u000aOpposite the hotel there is a proper 'all American' diner where you can have breakfast in massive portions!\u000aI don't have anything negative to say about the hotel at all.

VA new building is being constructed next door to this hotel. Therefore, VERY LOUD construction noise starts promptly at 7 AM and continues until 5 to 5:30 PM every day except Sunday.\u000aAs we were staying for 9 nights, we asked if quieter rooms were available.\u000aWe were advised that most of the rooms are noise affected.\u000aWe were eventually shown a few other rooms in the hotel that were quieter and/or larger. All were more expensive and none were available for all of our stay. The staff weren't very helpful in re-locating us to a quieter room. After a few false starts, it was all too hard. We ended up in a slightly larger room but just as noisy. For our troubles, we were charged an upgrade fee.\u000aLuckily, we had a hectic tour schedule, so we were out early and not back until late most days. One day we had a break and tried to have an afternoon siesta; not possible with the noise from next door.\u000aWe would not come back to this place, even after the construction works next door are finished.\u000aAlso, lift is very very slow. We were on about 7th floor but found it quicker to use stairs most of the time.\u000aWe moved to another place in SoHo for our last week. It was much better; larger rooms, no construction noise, friendly staff and much better karma all round.

So they are able to offer the rooftop bar, the cheese and wine, the breakfast, etc in what is in reality quite a small hotel.\u000aThe hotel doesn't have its own kitchen, room service, etc. it relies on shipped in produce for breakfast, and on the Italian restaurant at ground level for room service etc.\u000aWe opted for a bigger room when booking, and we're glad we did ... It was spot on in terms of space. We were on a lower floor, but the traffic noise didn't bother us at all unlike other reviewers.\u000aIt's a good location, lovely hotel, and we would definitely stay there if/when we return to NY.

VMy wife and I finished off our honeymoon with 3 nights in NYC. We always travel around, and end up bookink things late, as we go. We were therfore a bit worried with New York, as there are more hotels to choose from than anywhere else. However, we booked 3 nights at the Algonquin 2 days before we were due to arrive.\u000awhen we did arrive our luggage was taken care of, and the front desk staff were really pleasent. The room that we had was on the 7th floor, and looked out over the back - but this was good! The street at the front is quite busy so it may well have been a better view, but it would have been noisey. The room itself, was perfect. Very nicely decorated, lovely comfy bed, very very clean and crisp. The bathroom was excellent too. It generally had everything you needed.\u000aAs we had mentioned that it was our honeymoon, the management had left a bottle of fizzy wine on ice, some chocolates and a congratulations card! Bearing in mind that our honeymoon consisted of 8 flights, and 10 different hotels/guesthouses, and that this was the only place to give us a gesture, we thought it was pretty special.\u000aRegardless of the 'special' treatment, we thought that the Algonquin was a very high standard all round. The lobby bar is the kind of place where you are happy to have to dress smartly for. A great atmosphere. The hotel itself was perfectly located for our 3 night visit, being within walking distance of some wonderful sights, restaurants and bars.\u000aI note that another reviewer was disappointed at having seemingly a similar room fo $400 per night. I suppose if we had paid that much I would have been a little, but if you focus on the quality, it is probably the going rate in this location.\u000aWhatever, we were made really happy here - so thanks to the Algonquin.\u000aps - One negative, don't make any international calls ($$)\u000a

Turn his face back to facing his friend and keep going on their conversation, not even a good afternoon or offer for help, totally ignored.\u000aFront desk was not helpful as well, all the question we asked or requested, always answer with their robot face: you used points to REDEEM your room (Hello!

Okay, even no one there but I waited for 15 mins and three front desk staff was busy to chatting instead of helping me to find the staff whoever work there, I went back to front desk to double check the staff was not on break and see anyone can help, same as usual give me their robot face and said: you could just sit their and wait, I believe he will be back soon. Thank you for your wonderful suggestion.\u000aOh I forgot one thing, since we stayed here for few days, one day when me and my husband wearing luxury clothes and carrying luxury handbag, surprised our lovely bell person say good evening to us, even that was his first and only.\u000aNever come back as there a lot of choice around Times Square area.\u000aThank you for everything.

VBooked and Paid in full 2 nights August 2016 for the 3 of us, two oldies and our eight year old grandaughter, emailed the hotel 4 days after booking in November 2015,\u000ato ask if they could secure our luggage prior to checkin as we arrive at 6.0am\u000a4 more emails without reply, up to February, plus filling in twice there on line booking form.Still no reply!!.\u000aFinally Telephoned from the UK, spoke to Robert (the Manager) and asked for confirmation email they could secure our luggage, He said no problem, but guess what no confirmation, another call, Robert not in now for a few days and no one else to help!! what sort of Hotel leaves prepaid guests in this tricky position.\u000aMaybe stuck in a scary city with luggage and nowhere to go\u000aI would like to give them a better write up, but we have not yet stayed there.\u000aand worse to come, NO REFUNDS GIVEN Just what would you do £350/$400 down and still nowhere to stay.

Since we've been in New York many times, and have seen most of the sites, we wanted to stay in a place that has the proximity to the best shopping areas and restaurants, which SIXTY Soho most certainly does!\u000aThe hotel in itself is beautiful, with a great staff who is most helpful with anything. We got a very nice room on the 10th floor, with a great view! The breakfast menu is good, and the food & drinks with great quality.\u000aWe will most definitely be back!

VIt was a good hotel, we were on the fourth floor at the front to start with and it was a bit noisy as there is a mexican bar directly below (which has very good drinks and nachos!) we asked to be moved and they did this straight away and they put us on the 7th floor where we could not hear anything as it was at the back of the hotel. The maid cleaned our room everyday very well. The only thing would be that the wardrobes and furniture need updating but it was not a big deal. The beds were very comfortable and overall we were pleased with this hotel.

VDespite booking and pre paying for a 'Delux room' over two months in advance, on arrival one was not available.\u000aWe were instead placed in a room on the 3rd floor for the night with an apology that it may be a little noisy and an assurance that we would be moved to a better room for the remainder of our seven night stay.\u000aHaving been born and raised in London we didn't think it would be a problem for a night, especially after travelling for nearly a day and being exhausted with our late night arrival.\u000aIt was a late Saturday night and on the way to the room we passed used glasses and food trays left outside rooms which we thought should have been collected.\u000aThe room was OK but the telephone button specially for room service just goes to answerphone. I went back down to reception who told me in future just dial zero. We ordered room service which came after 45 minutes which was OK and settled down for the rest of the night.\u000a'Francisco' on the desk was not joking when he said it may be a little noisy. Despite being totally exhausted and the bed very comfortable, the street noise from outside and the 24 hour metro trains meant we only got a few hours sleep.\u000aHave they not heard of double or triple glazing?\u000aOur booking also included breakfast.\u000aThis consisted of a self service buffet with the server just pouring your coffee and orange juice and giving you a bill at the end. I queried it with the manager who told me don't worry 'just sign it'. She was right you don't get charged unless you have an extra such as Cappuccino which isn't explained to you.\u000aThis is good news as the cost of the breakfast is relatively expensive and a hefty service charge is added to the bill despite the fact you do most of the work yourself.\u000aService here was very indifferent from good to 'cant really be bothered' dependent on who you were appointed to so if you are paying for it I would question the hefty service charge.\u000aThe second room we had was on the 22nd floor which was the same room type as before but without the noise, good, clean & comfortable.(Delux)\u000aOn exit I signed the bill without paying to much attention due to the que behind me, but checking it at the airport I found I had been charged for someone else's lunch and under in room dining for an 'intimacy kit'. The dining has been removed but I would have to start pinging more e-mails to dispute the 'intimacy kit' usage. It may possibly have been the same persons lunch they wanted me to pay for; I couldn't be bothered taking it any further!\u000aIn summary.\u000aA brilliant central location for seeing New York but needs a bit more attention to customer services . If you stay make sure you get a room on the highest floor available.\u000aThe bar and breakfast are expensive but its a central location so that's only to be expected.\u000aWould I return? possibly

The rooms are snug, for sure, but the bathrooms are great--love the showers and the shower curtains--and even the shower curtain holders! The beds are comfortable, and the art headboards are always fun. If you're not in black, you'll stand out as a tourist--but whatevs; it's fun to stay here. Also, very convenient parking right across the street.

Decent sized rooms, great bathroom products, ridiculously comfortable linens, bowl of free goodies is a lovely touch and superlative overall service. Most recent example of great service was making a request for coffee when passing the reception desk on returning to hotel and having a chap at my room door with the coffee less than five minutes later. Restaurant is very high quality food and bar is as good as any that I have spent time in. Staff are very friendly and helpful - nothing too much trouble.

I appreciated the extra help I received from Pedro, the assistant manager. This is a residential hotel in a very nice neighborhood, and we are able to walk to most of the places we want to visit. The rooms are large, and with a fully equipped kitchenette. We have probably stayed at the Affinia 20 or more times in the last 5 years.

Upgraded my room to a suite, and Albert was an absolute savior tracking down my packages I had sent in a week prior. The suite was fantastic, with a great view from the balcony and fast room service, I could not have asked for a better stay in the city. Price was a bit steep considering it was booked close to my arrival date and during New York Comic Con, but it was worth every penny.

Rooms were also very quiet (we were street facing 10th floor) which is a plus in New York.\u000aStaff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Eddie at door! The only negative would be rooms are made up late in day, in our case between 5 & 6PM every day.

VWe booked the InterContinental Times Square at a reduced rate through the Hotels.com website. I can't vouch for value at full price, but this hotel was well worth the bargain nightly rate. I know the area well but had never been to this particular property before. It's located on the south side of 44th Street about 1/2 block west of 8th Avenue . . . close enough to Times Square to be convenient (especially for out-of-towners), but a block or so away from the full-blown craziness. The front of the hotel faces nothing attractive, mostly a large moral on the side of a building and a parking lot across the street with elevated ladder-type auto storage. Want to be close to the theater district and restaurants? This would be a good choice. If you're traveling with kids, be advised there are still a couple of X-rated peep show joints, a.k.a. "gentlemen's clubs" on the west side of 8th Avenue between 43rd and 44th (the good news is that the windows are covered).\u000aOn the other side of 8th Avenue, there is a McDonald's about 1/2 block away for those budget-conscious souls who are so inclined. At the corner closest to the hotel is Shake Shack, a restaurant that seems to be perpetually jammed. Better cuisine is available at any number of quality restaurants in the general area. Hint: Love cheesecake? There is none better than at Junior's, a casual, Brooklyn-based favorite only a couple of blocks away. As a Noo Yawker of many decades, I recommend this wholeheartedly. Yum!\u000aSo back to the InterContinental as a hotel. There is a nice restaurant/lounge in the hotel lobby (great place is get together with clients), and room service is available. I didn't deal with many of the employees, but here goes: efficient front desk, quick elevators with room card access requirement, clean room, comfy beds, extra pillows readily available from housekeeping, spacious walk-in tiled shower with both rain and wand spray. Don't move the dresser-top merchandise or mini bar goodies, or you automatically purchase them. Our room had two beds with plenty of space. We faced the front of the hotel and were on floor 10 as I recall. Nice touch in the bathroom: a makeup mirror that doubled as a night light. Surprisingly quiet room during this weekday stay. Penn Station is only a little over ten blocks away, and a subway stop is virtually next to the hotel.\u000aWould I stay there again? If the price was right, yes. Shop around first, and don't pay full freight. The InterContinental Times Square is a good choice for visitors, business people who want to be midtown-west, and/or anyone who wants to be near the theater district. My actual rating would gave been slightly under four stars due to the proximity to all the Times Square insanity, but I realize that lots of folks want exactly that. You be the judge.

VWe had a horrible experience here. We booked a 4-people bedroom for 4 nights through Bookings.com, with a "free cancellation" option, so we didn't have to pay anything until we checked in. We were arriving at night after a 10-hours flight from Italy. During our layover I got a phone call from my bank, saying that the hotel had tried to charge my card but the transaction was rejected. I phoned the hotel 3 times, and all the 3 times the person on the other hand told me that the reservation was still active. However, when we got to the hotel at 10.30am super tired, the guy at the reception told me our reservation was cancelled because of the rejected card. This upset me because we were tired and had booked one month in advance and I also called them to confirm my reservation, and it was written nowhere that they were going to charge my card. After being mean to me and treating me as if I was giving out fake credit card information and after having us wait for half an hour, the guy magically found us a room. A pretty crappy one also, super close to the power generator and super noisy at night. I called booking.com, which confirmed that the hotel had no right to charge my card, and that they should have sent me an email or informed booking.com before canceling my reservation. And also given all this, no one at the hotel ever apologized to us. I was expecting much better from Sheraton group, these people obviously don't know how to do their job. Never again.

Great location, interesting neighbourhood and close to the fabulous High Line, too.Never did sample the coffee since too crowded and impossible to get served. Spacious room with comfy bed, huge windows giving lots.of light, Wooden floors with Persian style rug underfoot, room overlooked side street so quiet.....unique in NYC! Lovely toiletries in bathroom. Poor lighting throughout room, impossible to apply make-up and no power socket close to a mirror to use hair dryer. A large fireplace dominated the room. No closet just a rack beside the door and not enough hangers either. This was room 43. No room service, apart from ice, so a tea or coffee machine should be offered in the room. Fridge in room was a bonus.

America and Cecila at the desk were also very helpful with directions and things to do. The location was perfect, just a short walk to Times Sq or Central Park without being in the center of craziness. The room was comfortable, clean, big, and had a gorgeous view. The lounge was spectacular, and Ous at the door there helped us out with some passes to a nightclub to help in the celebration. All in all, my 30th birthday wouldn't have been as spectacular without the friendliness and geniune care of the staff. Can't wait to visit again!

VMy daughter was having some issues in her apt in NY so to give her a break I treated her to at night at the NYLO NY. My husband and I had stayed there before and we liked that the hotel, which is in the middle of NYC but has this small boutiquey quaint vibe. We had excellent service in the past so we had no hesitation booking her there for a night. Unfortunately , there were some problems in her room that night . Ac didn't work, tv wasn't working and it took the staff a while to resolve the situation. They did eventually move her but it ruined her restful night at a hotel! When I called in the morning the manager had already been apprised of the situation and offered us money back. I explained that it wasn't about the money rather it was about wanting to give my daughter a relaxing night at a hotel. She asked me what we wanted and when I told her we wanted her to have that night without any hesitation she booked her into her same room for another night. Coming from the midwest I can say that we don't alway get midwest service in NYC . The NYLO was the exception. That is excellent customer service. We will definitely be staying at the NYLO again in the future.

VI have to say, I do understand the reviews that the hotel is a little basic etc, but you have to remember how much you actually paid to stay in MANHATTAN!!!!\u000aI visited New York City for 10 nights from the UK with a friend on mine for my 21st Birthday. It was the trip of the lifetime and we only used the hotel to sleep and shower, which I presumed is what others would do whilst visiting Manhattan... Obviously I'm mistaken?\u000aOur room was huge, a double and single bed, kitchenette area, dressing area and large enough bathroom for 2 guests. I personally just could not get over the location. It was unreal - $2.50 subway ride from Time Square, 30 minute walk to the Natural History museum and Central Park. Tonnes of places to eat and drink near by the hotel. Across the road from the Reception is a cute cafe, they do awesome food and juices in there! I really couldn't fault the place.....

Emailed in advance and asked for an early check in. Arrived at hotel at 1pm and had to wait until 4pm for room. The lady who checked us in was rather unfriendly and uninterested. All was redeemed the next morning when we met the wonderful Matthew. I should note that when we finally got checked in we had been upgrades and there was a nice bottle of bubbly in the room.\u000aBreakfast was great, loads of pastries, muffins, cereals, bagels etc. Plenty to choose from and tea and coffee was available in the lounge all day.\u000aBe sure to check out the roof top terrace for great views of the Empire State Building.

VNYC hotels are all ridiculously expensive so if you are going to pay the prices you might as well have a great experience. This hotel delivers. I usually book the suite which has three walls of glass. Otherwise it is an ordinary room, (king bed, little partition and sofa and chair), however those three walls of Windows offer a magnificent view of the greatest city in the world. The usual accoutrements for a hotel of this caliber. Minibar, robes, and nice minibar, etc. Members of the Ambassadors Club receive comp water and fruit. The lobby bar is very nice. Room service is above average. Location is NOT on what I consider Time Square but very close. For theater goers, as I am, hard to imagine a better location. Business center on lower level where guests may print boarding passes.

VI was pleasantly surprised with the hotel - it was new, modern, clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced compared to other hotels in New York over New Year\u000aHad I not gone to the Restaurant it would have been a very successful stay\u000aBUT we did go - twice\u000aOn the first day 30/12/10 I could not have a glass of wine as they had no corkscrew ! There was only one other couple eating when we were there. The food though was quite good\u000aOn the last night 2/1/11 I ordered a coffee and asked that it be hot - topping it up with hot water if necesssary. I think she was more interested in her texting as she obviously did not listen to what I had said and my lukewarm/cold coffee arrived which was duly returned! I then foolishly ordered the soup - guess what that was cold as well\u000aI then left the restaurant and as i was leaving I said to the young guy at the desk that it was no suprise to me that the restaurant was empty. My lift took a while to come and I heard him repeating my comment to the other staff and they found this really amusing\u000aMy friends stayed for a few more drinks and at 10pm an hour before the closing time the girl shouted last orders. Within minutes a large family party came in to eat and was about to be shown to their table when the girl stated that she had already closed and the people were asked to leave! The restaurant is advertised as open for food until 11pm

VTraveled with my mom and sister-in-law to experience Christmas in NYC. We had a great time at this hotel. The hotel is located in the hub of everything in Times Square, yet once inside it was relaxing and calm. The lobby smelled amazing (it smelled like Christmas!) and we commented on it every time we arrived at the hotel. The restaurant breakfast is a bit pricey, but the food was excellent. Staff was very helpful. Lounge with fireplace is a great place to grab a drink.

VA peaceful and calm sanctuary footsteps from the chaos of time square. Well-appointed and extremely quiet rooms with blackout shades to enhance sleeping experience. Service is outstanding and rivals that at four seasons and other top hotels. 24 Hour Fitness Center is well-equipped and reasonably sized for the scale of the hotel---on the same block, SoulCycle and equinox are available for those desiring a higher level of fitness opportunities. American breakfast buffet is fabulous (with superb service), Jake's coffee in the lobby is great for a quick latte, and rooftop bar is sublime. To boot, the hotel is pet friendly and Bryant Park is just a block away!

VI spent numerous stays in this place , but only because I m an IHG Spire Ambassador.\u000aFact is this is New York for you in terms of average service (except the bellmen) , and do not expect more than being in a convenient location and a new (few years) building. The rates also are **far from competitive since this is the only IC in town (the Barclay is still in works) , so booked solid all year long , they dont actually need your business Thank You.\u000aI have actually quit on expecting anything and do minimal noise since its such a lost fight and i try to keep my stays as minimal as possible ; will probably try my luck at the Conrad or Park Hyatt next time though.\u000aGreat views from the Studios (which are not actual suites , actually just a bigger room with a screen separator , but still nice.\u000aSecurity is present and effective.

VI have traveled extensively all over the world and will tell you our experience at your hotel for my Daughter's wedding was one of the best if not THE best I ever had. The staff was incredibly nice to all of our wedding guests (they all commented on how polite and friendly the staff was) and very helpful to assist in any way. The front desk staff was excellent. EVERY member of the Bellman's staff was superb! We had tons of luggage going in and out...taxi needs, car needs, limos and shuttles picking us up and they managed it all with a smile. And we couldn't have had a successful event without the help of the Marketing/Event Coordinating staff..\u000aThe rooms were very nice and the maid service was great. The restaurant and bar...including staff...was very good as well.\u000aWhen I need to stay in Manhattan....I'll be staying at the Hyatt Union Square.\u000aMy congratulations to you on a splendid operation.

VStayed here for 3 nights in January 2017 for daughter's 21st. I have visited New York 5 times before and stayed in 'posher' more expensive hotels but never again as this hotel is perfect. The ideal location. One block from Empire State Building, 1 minute from subway, 3 mins from Macys, 1 minute from 5th Avenue, 15 mins south of central Park. The hotel is clean, with all facilities you need. A lovely roof top view of the empire state building - no bar though when we were here just a perfect view. The gym is small but we'll equipped with water machine. Breakfast is continental and perfect. Lots of cereals, pastries, bagels' bread / toast, yoghurt, fresh fruit and muffins to die for! The biggest I have ever seen. Self service with a comfy dining area which doubles up as evening drinks lounge where free wine tasting occurs every evening 5-6.30. You are welcome to try red white or rose wine as many full glasses as you like! Very nice touch and guests get together and talk about days events which makes for a nice social start to the evening. We were in room 1218 (I think lol) which was perfect, quiet and fully functioning with complimentary coffee machine, soft drinks and also some chocolates and personalised note to wish my daughter a happy 21st in new York. We were provided with business facilities to aid flight check in and boarding pass printing. Every wish was attended to. Will definitely visit on next trip - no brainer!

VLuscious room, fantastic view, top standard accommodation by any standards. I'm not entirely sure what the price is for other rooms, but I paid $499 for a Deluxe room - one night. Admittedly, it was slightly more than I would usually be willing to pay for something I couldn\u2019t take home to look at, (bar a flight of course) but if I were to do it all again, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pay the bill twice. (ok, maybe not twice, cos that would be silly)\u000aThe lobby area boats a Grand Piano, swanky drinks bar and some classy music to put any traveller at instant rest. If someone were to be blindfolded and taken inside, I would say the victim could quite easily mistake the location for a gentleman\u2019s club before guessing it was a Hotel lobby. But then, I\u2019ve never been to a gentleman\u2019s club so I could be talking utter rubbish here too. Moving on....\u000aLocation\u000aRight in the centre of Manhattan, you cant go wrong with this work of art that is a hotel. A few seconds walk to the nearest tube station, (or subway as they like to call it in The US, not sure why cos I don\u2019t remember seeing a sandwich menu anywhere \u2013 beside the point) and a wealth of taxis to be hailed right from the hotel door step.\u000aRoom\u000aThe room was very spacious, although it was comprised of a bedroom, mini hall, bathroom and living area. Top athletes would find space to practice in this place. I always request the room to be as high as possible for the view. In this case, I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Everything I had dreamt a New York Hotel View should be, is what it was. Lush complimentary bathrobes are available for use within the room \u2013 as is an umbrella. (You would have to purchase them if you desired to take them out. Yes, even the umbrella)\u000aBathroom\u000aBathroom was again, spacious, clean and very comfortable to be in. I could see how people may have trouble using the toilet in fear of spoiling the ambient purity of the room.\u000aPros:-\u000aFree internet is available. If you don\u2019t have your own computer, facilities are provided.\u000aClose to many forms of public transport.\u000aHelpful polite staff.\u000aJust being in the hotel has a way of making you feel special!\u000aCons:-\u000aNot for you if you wont be spending much time in the room. Better off getting somewhere cheaper.

VGood location, easy for Empire State Building, Maceys, tour buses and 15 minute walk to Grand Central Station, Chrysler Building, and the beautiful New York Public Library (a must visit!). Friendly helpful staff, especially Jef - concierge - and the reception staff. Rooms are starting to get a little tired, but they are good size and nice toiletries. Excellent breakfast to start the day, no problem with the plastic cutlery and cups, there is plenty of choice and it is kept well stocked with fresh fruit salad, fresh fruit, cereal, muffins, croissants, toast. A bonus was the tea/coffee available 24 hours complimentary. Restaurant good , especially when arriving after a long flight. Only blip was on the Monday (27th Sept) rather grumpy barman and waitress.- no smile yet still added 18% service charge and complained we wanted to split the bill for cocktails and food onto 2 room bills, ours and our friends. Apart from that an excellent hotel for both business and pleasure. Very buzzy rooftop bar open til mid evening during the weekdays.

VThis Intercontinental is one of my favorite NYC hotels and I've stayed there several times. As an Intercontinental Ambassador, I always get upgraded to a corner king which has 2 walls of floor-to-ceiling windows and a large bathroom with a rain shower. This hotel now offers a choice of $20 minibar credit or 2 free drink coupons for your welcome amenity. The hotel is sandwiched between the restaurants of Hell's Kitchen and all of the Broadway theaters. Times Square is a only a few blocks away. The A-C-E subway stop is literally right outside your door and will get you to many popular tourist spots (Central Park, Chelsea Market, World Trade Center, even JFK airport).

Unprofessional greeting and on top of that I had to wait for 15mins to check a bag since my room wasn't ready. It wasn't the bellman's fault at all, he was the ONLY one on a busy day! The front desk guy (AA bearded male) kept looking over at me as I stood there wasting my time instead of offering to take my bag and check it. Wasn't impressed with his professionalism.\u000aRoom was clean and well organized. I kept pushing my 'do not disturb' button but the staff cleaned it 2 of the 3 days I was there...found that odd.\u000aGreat views of the city!!!! AMAZING views!! The roof bar is worth a visit.\u000aRestaurant food was delish and innovative. Service was great there at Print!\u000aBUT YOU NEED TO OPEN SATURDAY AT 7 FOR BREAKFAST!

The shower (if you can call it that) was small and offered lukewarm water (akin to the coffee). Worst of all was the noise! The paper thin walls didn't even dull the voice of the man next door who spent hours talking incessantly either to himself or on the phone - making physical threats and sounding psychotic. At around 3 am we snuck down to the lobby (didn't want to disturb the ax murderer) and said we either needed another room or we'd sleep in the lobby. We got another closet sized room and when morning came, we ran. Worst hotel ever.

VMy husband & spent 4 nights here in May 2009. We had room 800 which was high up and at the back so the veiws were nothing but it was lovely and quiet (we requested the higher room when booking). The bed was lovely and comfortable. The room was small but this is expected in large cities.\u000aThe bathroom was pleasant and provided all that was necessary for a hotel of this age and the water was hot. The room could become a bit stuffy but with the aircon on it freshened it up a bit - the aircon was noisy and so we had it turned off at night which meant that the room got warm but not too uncomfortable (day time temp was mid 70s) - we did not have the breakfast there as it was $20.00 for a continential but the cafe next door did a fantastic range of breakfast for around $10.00 per head with tip.\u000aLocation - near to everything and check out Jimmys bar on 44th b/w 5th and 6th for cheap drinks as the hotel bar is very expensive.\u000aThe lounge is great to hang out in and you often will see writers interviewed there\u000aOver all, very enjoyable for business persons or romatic partners but I would not recommend to a group of young people or to those with kids.\u000aStaff are excellent and have excellent knowledge of local events and are keen to stop and have a chat with you.

VSure this hotel is near times square but totally not worth the price. I reserved a deluxe room for one night... I was given a standard room. I have stayed in plenty of hotels and everyone of them offers free wifi, except this one. They have free wifi in the lobby only. Didn't spend much time in my room so this wasn't a big issue but its the principle of it. Woke up the next morning and started getting ready to leave two hours before checkout time when the room phone starts ringing and when answered I hear nothing but beeping. This continued every 5 minutes for a half hour until I called the front desk then it magically stopped. When I went down to the front desk to checkout, they had two people working the desk and 10 people standing around waiting to checkout. It took 30+ minutes to checkout where they tried to charge me for a bunch of stuff they said I took out of the minibar. I had 1 bottle of water and that was before I realized it was $10. If you do stay there, visit the deli around the corner on 8th ave for any drinks you might need.

VOur experience at the Algonquin spans 45 years, but to our deep regret, we won't be back. We were first attracted by the literary history and the lovely, cozy and quietly vibrant lobby, a lobby now modern, corporate-franchise and pedestrian. After the recent remodel and Mariott takeover, gone are the old rooms, gone are the deep bathtubs (replaced with a clear glass shower stall that leaked onto the floor), gone is the "New Yorker" Round Table with formally-dressed waiters, gone is the basket of apples at check-in, gone are the welcoming appeals to writers, and the cat Matilda is relegated to a storeroom, to be seen only upon request. Yes, the rooms are improved, neat and clean, but problems persist. Our particular suite (comfortable, with a large sitting room and king-sized bed) had the heat turned off--because, it turns out, the noisy, water hammer-afflicted heater was leaking onto the carpet. And the new TV (we had a 16 year old along) annnoyingly dimmed unless bathed in a strong light, plus had limited channels. The staff response to these issues was quick, but ineffective, and the manager compensated with a free breakfast.

VWe treated ourselves to a stay here after the opera, and it was a winner! The location is ideal, in the heart of Midtown Manhattan on a quiet side street. The front desk staff was super-nice and upbeat, and the small lobby\u2019s inventive, high-style décor had loads of eye appeal. (We didn\u2019t try the bar but it looked cozy.) We were very kindly upgraded to a massive corner studio, 509, which had no view\u2014but I live in New York so I can see the Chrysler Building anytime. Our expansive room was gorgeous, with an enormous bed, red velveteen accent chairs, and a citified \u201c1940s Hollywood\u201d swank we both enjoyed. Of special note was the long entrance hall and dressing table with a light-up Deco-style mirror, and a walk-in closet. Wow! Beautiful bathroom, which though small, made great use of contrasting tiles and chrome accents and was stocked with lovely Sicilian toiletries. Great sleep, quiet, dark, no complaints. Well, except that we regretted no free coffee in the room/lobby, an amenity most boutique hotels now offer. And one window was missing a blackout shade. But no matter, this chic, friendly, central hotel with SPACE is now on my list of NYC faves.

VArrival to the hotel from JFK Airport was pretty straightforward, all I did was ring reception and they gave clear instructions on which trains to use to get here - 35 minutes later I arrived; its visible from Penn Station and was just a 5 minute walk to the reception.\u000aThe reception is light, airy and welcoming as are the entire team here; I was greeted warmly, checked in quickly and had all the facilities explained. My room was on the 5th floor but faces a wall, and in the early evening it's really hard to tell how late it really is BUT the rooms are pretty DECENT, I have no idea why there is any references to them being small, I have stayed in 'premium' hotels with smaller rooms. A lovely clean room, well kept and cleaned carpets, a great bathroom, with a proper sized shower, which is a fantastic size if you are a 'larger' sized traveller.\u000aThe hotel is well positioned for travel into the heart of New York or the financial district and if you are on a 'do it yourself trip' I can't honestly think of a better place to stay. First time here and I'd definitely return to this hotel, no question about it!

I'm sorry to say what a disappointment we had my shower had no water pressure, at night I was not able to sleep from the noise coming from the AC unit it sounded like a rat was in the unit scratching away and the musty smell coming from the unit made my throat scratchy! The most disgusting thing of all was the fact that I had to flick from my pillow a ROACH of all things!!! Aside from all that we got nickeled and dimed for everything! I would not recommend this place not even to my worst enemy!!

VI love the Giraffe - it's the third visit for my wife and I and I can't see me choosing another hotel unless too many people discover the secret and I can't get in. The hotel helped us so much last year when we hurrying home as a result of family emergency. The service is understated, but always courteous and responsive. The complimentary breakfast in the foyer and the evening cheese and wine receptions are a real treat. Room,s are comfortable and a decent size, especially the terrace rooms. A minor quibble is the glass fronted toilet door (or restroom depending on your preference); a solid door would afford more privacy, especially in the suites. Location on 26th and Park is close enough to familiar sightseeing spots, but far enough away to get some peace if that's the aim. Exceptional.

VThe very low rate for a non-hostel hotel is very tempting, but you really do need to be prepared to a budget-level experience. Not helped by the fact that the hotel, against all odds, tries to market itself as at least a mid-range hotel. It is not. I attempted to contact guest services on 2 occasions, once to discuss an internet charge, and once to attempt to extend my stay. The phone rang and rang but was never answered. I went to the lobby looking for help, but the guest services desk was empty and the people at the registration desk simply told me I would need to call guest services. Who never picked up the phone. The check-in process was much too lengthy, with not enough people helping. Rooms (mind you, the renovated rooms, which look nothing like the pictures on the website) were dingy with useless climate control. Thin bath towels and sheets, Two very thin pillows for a king bed -- and as noted above, just try calling somebody to ask for additional pillows, towels, etc. I needed to check my bag for the day, only to find out that a "luggage ticket" needed to be purchased for $5. Which is unheard of in my experience. Even at budget hotels, checking luggage is typically a tip-based service or, at most, $1 a bag. The only thing to speak highly of is location and value, I suppose, though it's questionable how much value there is when the service is so poor.

VI have stayed at this hotel a few times and never have any complaints. Our most recent trip to NYC was for the Christmas in Rockefeller Spectacular. The staff at this hotel is AWESOME! Always smiling and greeting you when you walk in. Although, check-in isnt until 3pm, we were allowed to check in a little after 1pm (Thanks Ivette)! If there aren't any rooms available-don't worry-they will store your luggage until check in....and after check out if you don't plan on leaving the city right away! The rooms are really small, but their cleanliness makes up for it! Parking is around the corner on 46th in a garage ($35-$45 for 24 hours depending on whether you have a car or SUV.) Be on time to pick up your vehicle or you will be charged for another 24 hours. The continental breakfast is good (biscuits, eggs, sausage, cinnamon buns, toast, bagels, yogurt, cereal, juice and coffee). The location of this hotel is GREAT! Only a couple of blocks to Rockefeller Center in one direction and a few blocks to Times Square in the other direction.\u000aI hope this review helps!

VAnother fabulous Kimpton Hotel, The Ink48 Hotel hosted our wedding party's recent stay in Manhattan and our reception lunch was held in their Print Restaurant. Naturally we were a bit nervous about how such an event for 20 guests would come off, but everything actually went very well. Everyone was happy and had only great things to say about this cool boutique hotel and it's impressive venues. A complimentary bottle of wine was left for us in our top-floor suite which offered fantastic views of the NYC skyline and the Hudson river. We love the trendy Hell's Kitchen location close to nightlife, restaurants, museums and the middle of everything is only a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Up on the rooftop, the Press Lounge's breathtaking miracle views of The City are just unbelievable. The Print Restaurant's service and delicious cuisine certainly did not disappoint. We would like to thank the staff of the Ink48, Print and Press Lounge for their part in making this memorable event such a success.

VMy boyfriend and I stayed at Cassa for 8 nights and it was great. We were planning on staying for 7 nights but our flight got rescheduled a week before our trip so they managed to book us for an extra night with no problems. Also we had a few packages delivered and they had to problem receiving them. The staff really went out of their way to help and make the stay as enjoyable as possible, they were all extremely friendly.\u000aThe room was big and very comfortable. Breakfast was simple but enough to get you started in the morning. The Wifi worked perfectly.\u000aIt was very cold in NYC when we went and the only complaints we had were that the heater wasn't enough to make the whole room warm enough.\u000aAll in all, our stay was absolutely wonderful, we were so sad to leave.

VMy wife and I were very pleased with our 3 night stay. The location was near perfect for our needs: walking distance to the Brwy theatres, subway stations, and bus stops. Our room, although compact, was clean, quiet and equipped with ironing board, iron, and hair dryer. Included in the price was a daily breakfast that exceeded our expectations - eggs, bacon, sausage, juices, fruit, coffee cake, french toast, yogurt, hot and cold cereals, beverages.\u000aThe hotel staff was friendly, accomodating, and competent. We were able to get into our room 2 hours prior to the 3 pm specified time. There was no charge to check our bags for several hours after checking out, so we could visit the Art Museum unhindered on the final day of our visit. A copy of the US News was slipped under our door every morning. Local calls were free, as was use of 2 PCs and printers in the lobby.\u000aThe only glitch was a 15 minute delay in returning our two bags to us when we returned to the hotel after our museum visit so we could proceed to Penn Station to return home. We will give top consideration to staying at this hotel on our next visit to NYC.

VWe booked through HotWire & got a great price. We needed a hotel for one night so we could enjoy a concert at the Beacon Theater & then spend some time in the City. The location was perfect for our needs. It was only a short 1 block walk from the subway station on 79th & Broadway.\u000aThis hotel was lovely. The design is old world charm with ornate details. Not a cool, modernist line in sight but all of the amenities were first world & had been upgraded recently. The bathroom was large by NYC standards. It contained a full bathtub & I didn\u2019t hit my knees when using the toilet. The complimentary toiletry products were from Avena. Our room had majestic high ceilings. There was enough room to walk around. The alarm clock / radio was hi tech as was the flat screen TV. There was a safe in the closet. The bed came with a lot of throw pillows. Decoratively they were nice, but what was the point? There was no place to put them so we ended up throwing them on the floor while we slept. I doubt the shams get changed between guests because I didn\u2019t see anything other than towels & white sheets on the housekeeper\u2019s cart so that seemed kind of gross. We were thrilled that the heat/AC unit worked efficiently and quietly.\u000aA few things made it less than perfect. The door opens right into the room. With that door open anyone standing in the hall can see all the way into the room & see all your stuff. If you open the door while your partner is say changing or even sleeping anybody in the hall could see that too.\u000aThe walls to the hall are thin. Overall the hotel was delightfully quiet. However, I was awakened early when somebody in the hall coughed. Even with the wall between us that person was probably less than 3 feet away from where I was sleeping & that cough sounded like it happened right over top of me.\u000aI was a bit irked that the door into the restaurant by the elevators is actually locked. If you want to go to the restaurant you have to go outside & walk around.\u000aAlthough the lobby is quaint (a euphemism for small) I think it would be a huge boon to weary travelers & the many guests who populate the lobby after they check out if the hotel provided a source of cold water. They do offer a bottle of Evian in the room for $6.45. If you walk across the street to Duane Reed you can get the same bottle for $2.39. If you drink the drugstore\u2019s house brand, that size is only $1.59.\u000aThe front doors to the hotel are quite heavy but the doormen are efficient. They will hold your bags after you check out which enabled us to explore the neighborhood unencumbered.

VOkay, here it goes. First of all, have cash or traveler's checks. I knew that and was prepared. Second, don't stay in a room facing street. It was so loud that my bed rattled and shook when big trucks drove by all night long. The second and final night, I moved across the hall. I was spooked when I saw the smoke alarm door hanging open with no batteries. Then, it was creepy that there was no deadbolt, but the envelope the key came in said to always use a deadbolt. I asked the employee at the desk (which is behind a locked plexiglass wall) if there was a deadbolt and he said the door would lock satisfactorily. Each room has a window unit air conditioner. Ask to stay on the main floor if you stay there because the steps are narrow and very steep. Remember no elevator. It was convenient for where I needed to be. The room was clean, bed was fine, but know it's very very tiny. Carpet was kind of dirty in the second room. I would not recommend this to a friend. It's best for students traveling. I might not have been so creeped out if someone else was in the room.

VThe hotel location is fantastic! You are very well situated for easy walking to/from Grand Central, American Girl, Time Square, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and Restaurant Row. You will have quite a walk to Central Park, Metropolitan, American Museum of Natural History, or Intrepid Museum (though we did make that long walk to/from) so a taxi ride is better option to save time and energy.\u000aThe rooms are very tiny. It is a very tight squeeze for a family of four but the hotel does make good use of the space. It would be nice if the TV was mounted to the wall to add some dresser top space. I\u2019d rather have the space than the huge TV. The bathroom is relatively good size and allows you good movement for one person. Counter space is limited but sufficient. We knew the rooms were small going in but we picked this place for location. Room was clean and done when we got back each day.\u000aWe were located on the 4th floor facing the street. We actually liked the lower floor as it allowed us to take the stairs. One of the elevators was not work for the first day but was fixed. We had a room with window which I would recommend. We did not have any issues with street noise though the A/C was running as the room was a bit warm and stuffy. The floor was quite. No other room noise.\u000aCheck In/Out was uneventful as one would hope. We were 1 hour early for check-in but they were able to get us a room rather than wait. Staff was very responsive in bringing extra towels and other toiletries. Staff was friendly.\u000aThe breakfast offering was good though seating space is limited so we took it back to our room. The included breakfast is a huge perk for this hotel considering how expensive eating in NYC can be for a family of four.\u000aOverall, we had a very good stay.

VWe had high expectations for this hotel on our recent trip to NYC based on previous IHG hotels we had stayed at.\u000aWe stayed 6 nights and whilst the hotel is very nice and in a great location - its just not quite up to the same standard as other IHG group hotels around the world.\u000aThe service levels were hit and miss. Our interactions with the front desk, doormen and concierge were very good. The Ambassador check in desk were approached twice and asked for assistance and both times we received no or I don't know as the answer. This would not happen in other locations - they would seek further information or another staff member to help us.\u000aHousekeeping on a daily basis was hit and miss, turn down service half done or not done at all, no water left, no tissues, bins not emptied. Overall its not enough to say the hotel is ordinary - because its not - its just not what we have seen in China, Australia, NZ, Vietnam etc......\u000aGreat beds and very quiet considering the busy location.\u000aThey could try a bit harder to make this a premium hotel.....

The room was a large, corner suite. The bedding was deluxe and comfortable. This room had an excellent shower and nice Moulton Brown toiletries. The only negative was the heating system which was weak and took a long time to heat the room. We would recommend this hotel highly and will stay again on our next trip to NY.

All the reviews mentioned that the staff and especially the concierge couldn't do enough for you. Not once in our 5 days did anyone ask if we were having a good time, if we needed anything etc, No-one except the doormen let on we were even there!! It was my husbands 50th birthday whilst there (I had emailed hotel about this prior to our arrival) wasn't expecting much, but even a complimentary drink in the bar would have been nice, but nothing.

Located just under the Empire State, one minutes walk from Macy's couldn't be any more central. The room we had was quite small but it seems all rooms in New York are small. Reception staff are nice and pleasant. Concierge booked our favourite restaurant for the Saturday night which was great. Live the roof top garden even though the bar is closed up there in winter you can still go up and check out the view. Had breakfast every morning which would keep you going till dinner time.As I said only stayed here once but going back! See you on December 2nd. Can't wait.!!

VOur room was on the 8th floor.\u000aThe good: the people; the location; the bed in our room. The front desk personnel, the concierge, and the housekeeping staff were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The location is super convenient, particularly if you know the subway system. Lots of close, reasonable restaurants nearby. The Symphony Space is right around the corner. Our bed was clean and comfortable, the unrenovated room was simple but OK.\u000aThe bad: wifi was *horrible*!! Could not hold a stream; kept dropping. Very annoying and very inconvenient. Had to unplug radio and lights to plug computer into the room's very few electric outlets. (Maybe this is better in the renovated rooms? But at an additional $50 per night, did not want to find out.) The printer was not working--could not print out boarding passes. Half of the elevators were not working. Guests and staff had share the only two working elevators making them slow, hot, and crowded. The end of the cleaning staff's workday found us sharing an elevator with half a dozen vacuum cleaners and many containers of cleaning supplies. Ice could only be had on the 5th and 9th floors. Could not check in a minute before 3PM. Had to wait.\u000aThe ugly: the heat and smell of the hallways. They reeked of what seemed to be stale cooking smells. Our floor smelled like old curry. Walking out into the hall was like walking into a sauna.\u000aIn sum: Would not go out of way to come back. If we could not find another hotel and were really in need of somewhere to stay in Manhattan, we'd check it out but hope to find a better place. Given all of the property's problems, it makes its "reasonable" rates overpriced.

The bed was very comfortable but noise from Emergency Vehicles and other traffic was very disturbing, the sound reduction quality of the double glazed windows was totally inadequate and could not reduce the sound of New York's drivers love of their vehicle horns. No coffee making facilities in the room was also inconvenient and added greatly to the expense.\u000aThe food in the Bar & Grill was good but very expensive as were the drinks however even these high costs were exceeded by the excessive18% service charge added to ALL bills even when sat at the bar. However, despite these criticisms we greatly enjoyed our stay and the location of this hotel was convenient to shops, attractions and transport. Staff were friendly and helpful especially Rodney and RC in the Bar& Grill who went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

I'm not sure I'd stay there again though as a bit pricey and now I have my bearings. Two alcholic drinks in the bar cost just over $20 so avoid that - there are plenty of cheaper places nearby. Never ate in the hotel either. Hotel was clean and after having to move room a few times due to them keeping allocating us one just outside the lifts (and one had an unclean bathroom) it was fine.\u000a

The rooms were clean and tidy, the beds comfortable, bathrooms are small but......your in New York....No time to waste lounging in a bath...showers are fine, everything we needed.\u000aThe Affinia is so central you couldn't ask to be better located, step outside Manhattan Gardens is literally across the road.....we went to a Knicks game...Wow...brilliant and they won beating Utah. Macy's is a 5 minute walk, Times Square another 5 minutes.\u000aBUT then it SNOWED.........and this is when the Affinia really stepped up.... The staff were ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, our flight was cancelled....twice.....and on both occasions the staff helped us with everything...they kept us informed on all emergency procedures, rebooked our rooms, sorted out our bills for insurance, and because New York shut down and unless you ventured into the storm, you were stranded in the hotel, they put on hot chocolate and a meet and greet session for all its guest, the weather was that bad that even the staff had to sleep in and they still remained happy and upbeat.\u000aWould 100% return to the Affinia

The room was very nice, but not too spacious(ok, it´s N.Y.). But the best was the staff - everybody was very friendly and helpful, but also highly professional. All of them made us feel welcome, and the front desk(especially Lubi!) did a great job giving tips, making reservations and sending us in the right direction.

VFirst of all, I love historic hotels and this hotel is one of my favorites in the midtown area. Very good location, very classy feel, and for the most part very friendly staff. The restaurant/bar staff was extremely friendly and greeted me by name on multiple occasions. We stayed in one of the premiere suites which was massive for a NYC hotel room. Wait times for room/bellhop service was very long on a couple of occasions, but I realize this was during a very busy time, so I could overlook this. The biggest issue with our 6-night stay was that when packing up on the last day we were examining the room to ensure we were not leaving anything and found a dirty diaper behind the curtain. It was a bit disturbing that the diaper had been there through 7 days of housekeeping without being found and cleaned (we did not have any children in the room). Overall, I would recommend the hotel, but be sure to examine the entire room upon check-in to ensure that it has had a thorough cleaning prior to your arrival.

VThe hotel has all the facilities one would expect of a five star property. However the level of service is only average at best. Compared to other five star hotels we have had the good fortune to visit, the staff at The Trump seemed more interested in talking to one another than ensuring their guests are taken care of. No bellman was on hand to take our luggage to our room. Our room was not turned down when we arrived (middle of the night) and only had sufficient towels for one person. The doormen did not once welcome us back to the hotel during our 3 day visit. Housekeeping did not service our bedroom until 3pm and only then at our request. Individually these are small issues but the cumulative effect is to create a customer experience that is not five star.\u000aIn particular we disliked the hard sell on arrival (for an additional 75 dollars per night we have a special rate for an upgrade etc) and the very high margin they proposed to charge for arranging a car to take us to the airport - we chose to arrange this ourselves using UBER instead.\u000aIt was also annoying that we could hear the elevator from our room - we were some distance away so those rooms adjacent to th elevator must be pretty noisy. The air conditioning was very loud, to the extent we had to turn it off at night in order to sleep.\u000aFittings and finishings are excellent quality. Bed linen is also very good. The spa looked to be well maintained.

VI stayed at the beautiful Avenue Suite with a great view down 6th, especially at night it was hypnotic to watch the light trails. The building is a beautiful old New York skyscraper with a lot of character, but felt very well maintained. Although the spaces aren't massive (e.g. the lobby is quite crowded), it's much preferred to the less atmospheric hotels for me. Extremely friendly service and a great location for going for a morning run to Central Park, as well as easy access to subway & sights such as Rockefeller Plaza.

The bathtub should have strips at the bottom to prevent slipping. On Sunday morning the complimentary coffee ran out at 9:00, and it took a while before the situation was remedied.

Very helpful staff, clean, and most of all, even though the rooms are small like all NYC hotel rooms, they were "big enough." (Last year we stayed at the Holiday Inn in Chelsea. The room was so small, there wasn't even a place to put our luggage.) The breakfast was very good, as was the elevator service. We would definitely stay here again.

VI just returned from a trip to NYC with my daughter. We had booked the Warwick through Priceline and had never stayed there before. The Warwick has a WONDERFUL location! Close to Rockefeller Center, Central Park, MOMA, etc. The lobby, although small, is beautifully decorated and elegant. The doorman was quite helpful, and the desk attendants were cordial and allowed us to check in almost three hours early. The bathroom was beautiful, had a wonderful make-up mirror, but was very small for the price. The room was also small, but had beautiful crown molding, a nice TV and lovely curtains. The only disappointing aspect was the fact that some of the furniture was marked and somewhat discolored. The location of the room was good--sixth floor and a view of Ave. of Americas. The room was very clean and had no bedbugs. The bed was very comfortable and the comforters were wonderful. It was warm this past week in NY, so the room was toasty--we could not open the windows and the air conditioning did not work--I read some one else's review and found it was because the air-conditioning is turned off in winter. That would have been nice to know from front desk staff or a note in the room. Other than that, my daughter and I enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel for a traveler whose priority is location and lovely aesthetics.

VWe stayed here early June 2008 for a long weekend and we absolutely loved the Kitano. It was my first time going to NYC, so we wanted to stay somewhere centrally located that wasn\u2019t a dump or overpriced. After doing some research we came across the Kitano and got a pretty good rate after we contacted the hotel directly. The entire hotel looked great and our room was fantastic. We had a view of the Chrysler building (it looks spectacular at night) and a charming little church. I loved the huge flat screen tv, the big comfortable bed, and most importantly the soundproof windows. The restaurant is very expensive. We decided to eat breakfast there one morning and it came to $60, and we really didn\u2019t get that much.\u000aThe staff was very friendly and helpful. When we arrived the concierge told us that parking was $40 a day (I thought it was absurd, but whatever). I asked him if there was anyplace else that was close but cheaper. He said parking on the street was free on the weekends. He parked my car for me right outside the hotel and I ended up only paying for his tip.\u000aWe walked to Times Square, Grand Central Station, the Chrysler building and the Empire State building. It was only a couple blocks from the subway, so going to Central Park and the statue of Liberty was surprisingly not that big of a deal.\u000aWe lucked out by finding the Kitano and we\u2019ll definitely stay here the next time we come to NYC.

VMy husband and I stayed in a studio suite at the Affinia Manhattan. Since we arrived on Friday morning, our room was still occupied so we couldn\u2019t check in but the bellman graciously stored our bags in their storeroom. We came back a couple of hours later and were able to check in. The desk clerk remembered me and since I had already given her my ID and credit card information, all we had to do was get our room keys.\u000aWe had a spacious studio suite. The kitchen area had a bar, small refrigerator, a drawer style microwave, dishes, and glasses so we were able to purchase food and drinks to bring back to our room to eat there. There main area of the room had a desk, sleep sofa, two comfy chairs, and a double size bed. The curtains in the room were very heavy and blocked out the lights so it was easy to sleep late in the mornings. The only drawback was that the air conditioner was right beside the bed and was very noisy. The bathroom was small but adequate size for our needs and stocked with a spa collection of large pump bottle shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the tub.\u000aWe were in New York for the Macy\u2019s fireworks show on Long Island so we talked to Marina, one of the concierges, to arrange a car for the trip. She was on the phone for 10 to 15 minutes with multiple people to get the best price for us. We ended up saving $20 each way over the price she had gotten for someone else the day before. Kudos to Marina for doing a great job for us!\u000aThe hotel has a restaurant with a bar but we did not eat there. There are lots of small restaurants in the area within walking distance and a Starbucks across the street. This hotel is in a great area with Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and the Empire State Building close by.

Every time we spoke to the folks at the desk, were greeted with a smile.\u000aWhile there is a restaurant on the top floor I would avoid it. It's overpriced and you are paying for atmosphere. We did order food in, and it is delivered to the room lime room service.

VAs expected, we arrived early and the room was not ready, so we walked to get some theatre tickets at TKTS. On return, we discovered the room did not have a bath (tub) - which is something we value and assumed would be commonplace. Although full, they suggested that we use the allocated room that night and then they would review the situation in the morning. In the meantime, would we please enjoy a free breakfast the next day. Next day, Mille had arranged an upgrade (at no extra cost) to a room with a tub.\u000aThe hotel staff were so friendly ( The Concierge booked us into Sardis and Anne checked our other reservations and Walter was on hand in the evening for any other arrangements.)\u000aTheir courtesy and kindness to us was so unexpected when one hears other stories of New York hotels. The door staff were forever getting bags and opening doors- always with a cheery smile: they were also able to get a cab on a rainy morning which is quite a feat.\u000aOverall, a much better stay than we have had at other hotels ( including the Waldorf Astoria). The 24 hour self service coffee/tea arrangements and also ice- all at no charge- are much appreciated.\u000aThank you again to all the staff. Would unhesitatingly recommend it to our friends.

As a New Yorker and someone familiar with the city this was the perfect location, perfectly midtown a small walk to the museums uptown or the a beautiful walk to village and downtown.\u000aFor someone unfamiliar with NYC this may seem a little bit of a walk. But my experience, the hotel room, the above par professionals, the design and guest--made me a Kimpton believer and joined the loyalty program.

VMy wife and I stayed here in April for a combo long weekend / business trip. It was very convenient for accessing Time Square and the surrounding area. A bit of a walk to Central Park but not too bad. We enjoy old architecture so we really enjoyed the look and feel of the hotel. The Lobby was really nice with a warm old world feel. The room was fairly typical for New York being smaller than today's traditional rooms but still enough room to enjoy the weekend. The room was clean and well maintained. We did not interact with the staff much but when we did they were friendly. It is a New York hotel and part of the Autograph collection so the room rates are rather high.

VA Hyatt you say? Yep, this a not a huge hotel like the name suggests. Eleven floors of rooms \u2013 two elevators, so not too many rooms on each floor. While the second floor rooms have balconies, they face Fourth Avenue so the sounds of the city and a nearby fire house are evident. Our room was an upper floor \u2018courtyard\u2019 one, small but well appointed with clean lines and a nice modern feel. Bathrooms and beds are the key to a good hotel room and our were very good.\u000aWhat makes this property truly outstanding is the staff and excellent restaurants and bars. And the location is convenient even if you do have meetings way downtown or midtown. Remember this is a relatively small boutique-like hotel but the two bars and three restaurants are truly outstanding and memorable.\u000aOne important thing to know if you are planning a theater night, getting there couldn\u2019t be easier. Walk one block to the 14th Street-Union Square subway entrance and take the Q train to Times Square-42nd Street. It\u2019s a direct no-stop service, same is true after the show \u2013 no in between stops \u2013 express service.

VI have stayed here before when this was hotel was the Tribeca Grand, and the refurb into the Roxy as it is today is a huge improvement - I liked the hotel before, but it was a bit bland and could be any hotel, anywhere, now as the Roxy it feels more quirky and unique. Downstairs it has a great coffee bar with the baristas dressed in 1930s flat caps serving steaming lattes, and the bar is a great meeting point with live jazz and delicious cocktails. I am a bit of a breakfast geek and the breakfast and brunch was outstanding - avacado eggs and toast being a bit of a favourite of mine! The room was actually reasonably sized by NY standards which makes a nice change in Manhattan and I couldn't fall the porters who were incredibly attentive and helpful. The location is great for Soho and Battery Park - so good for site seeing and shopping but a bit of a trek in a taxi to midtown. Good location for the metro through if you don't mind public transport. I loved it here. AND free movies at the cinema downstairs.... what more could you want

VThis hotel is perfect for typical NYC shopping & sight seeing visit. My husband and I spent 5 nights here on our honeymoon - was only at the hotel to sleep! Breakfast was better than nothing, you get eggs and bacon and then bagels & bread etc - very simple yet good to grab a bite if you're heading out in a rush. There are not many seats, breakfast is served in the lobby so you will need to get there pretty early if you want to sit and eat! Location is fantastic - we walked every where... even to Madison Square Garden where we had booked a few sports events (took about 15-20mins, but when we asked reception he said to take a cab because it was so far to locals). Times Square is behind the hotel, about a 7min walk and Fifth Avenue is at the front of the hotel - 2min walk. I would definitely recommend this hotel to sleep in if you have plenty of activities planned, which is highly likely in the Big Apple!

VThe Warwick is a lovely hotel in a great location in midtown Manhattan. Our "premier plus king" room was very spacious by NYC standards and the bed was extremely comfy! The windows actually opened and we were able to enjoy the beautiful spring breeze, as the a/c didn't seem to cool the room down enough. The BIG drawback was the TINY bathroom. When I say tiny, I mean so tiny that you could barely move. The sink was so small and had a ledge above it that trying to brush one's teeth was a creative experience. And forget my husband trying to shave at the sink. That was done in the shower. Can't tell you how many times I whacked my head on that ledge. You truly had to duck under the ledge to try and wash your face and brush your teeth. Water was all over the floor as a result. I don't know if all the bathrooms are like this, but avoid room 1109 for sure. There is no tub, although one is depicted in the online floor plan of the room. We enjoyed our stay, but it was only for two nights and the bathroom was bearable. Any longer and I would have gone insane! I'll post pictures so you can see what I mean!

VI just wanted to add a review for Hotel Metro to endorse most of the comments added.\u000aWe stayed in November 2006 for 6 nights on our first trip to New York. The hotel is in a fantastic location with Macy's and the Empire State building very near by.\u000aThe room was very clean and maid service excellent. The room was average sized with the bed very comfortable and a great shower. There were fresh towels daily and the bed was also changed every day.\u000aWe found the staff very helpful and always friendly. Our in room safe was not working and within 15 minutes of reporting to reception a maintenence guy knocked on our door and fixed it. The reception staff were always willing to help with queries and booked us some tours and the airport taxi service with no problems.\u000aThe 24 hour coffee in the lobby was always appreciated. We needed to ask for fresh milk a couple of times but this was sorted with a smile! The breakfast was plentiful every morning consisting of bagels, muffins and fresh fruit.\u000aThe rooftop terrace looks out onto the Empire State building and is a lovely place to sit in the evening after being on your feet all day. Being November it was never busy but I bet in summer it gets crowded.\u000aWe would recommend this hotel to any traveller. We will certainly be booking to stay here again.\u000a

VWe usually like Kimpton hotels, and had been to Ink48 before and enjoyed it. So this time we splurged for a suite overlooking the Hudson, which turned out to have a good view, even though we were only on the 8th floor (note: the 8th floor is the absolute lowest that you should accept for a Hudson Suite -- we saw more of the Verizon trucks on the roof across the way, than the river, but we could see the Intrepid and most of the water). The problem was that the heating in the room was horrendous. The unit was VERY loud, and one part of the suite was very hot and the other icy. That said, the bathroom was to die-for, and the staff was super nice and helpful. We would give Ink48 another try, but if we have issues again, we are going to go looking.

VEverything about this hotel was absolutely fantastic. The property itself is definitely one of the more unique Hyatt properties out there - all the amenities you'd expect from a high end Hyatt but with the intimate feel of a boutique hotel. Diamond benefits during this stay included breakfast for 2 at the hotel restaurant ($25 per person), and since we were celebrating a special occasion, an upgrade to one of the most incredible suites I've ever stayed in (an outdoor deck large enough for entertaining 20+ guests, a 2-person rainfall shower the size of most bathrooms...) For a NYC hotel, the gym was also much bigger than I expected...was able to get a decent workout in before an evening of gluttony. Service was impeccable, from check in to the speediness of the ice/glasses we requested to be brought to our room. Location also can't be beat...drop a pin in the middle of all the sights you'd want to visit in NY and it'd be in Union Square. Would without a doubt return to this hotel on my next visit to NY.

VMy family of five has just completed a five night stay in a two bedroom suite at the Warwick Hotel. We live in Israel and have been to many European and US hotels, and the Warwick has outdone even the best of those experiences.\u000aWe have three children, so stayed in a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms.\u000aThe suite was the size of a lovely NYC apartment and decorated beautifully. With tasteful, modern design and every imaginable comfort, not the least of were the incredibly comfortable beds. The room was extremely quiet as well.\u000aThe hotel itself has a lovely European, boutique style with warm and caring service.\u000aAnd the area is very well situated to 5th Ave shopping, a five minute walk to Central Park, and numerous subways a block away. It's also quite nice to have a few excellent options for breakfast or quick snacks on the same block. The area is very safe, as well.\u000aThe overall price for this suite was very reasonable compared to what we were offered at other hotels.\u000aOur friends in NY came to visit us in the suite and were amazed at the size and beauty of the space.

Of note - many rooms face onto a wall which makes it quiet but no view and little daylight... Also, by way of outrageous, a bottle of water was $9.50 from the mini bar. And also charge for internet which is a pet peeve of mine - as well as use of the use of the computer in the business centre.

VI was lucky to stay in a large suite with a terrace, it had a seperate bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette and a living room w/ desk, couch, end tables and coffee table. It felt like we were living in an apt in Upper East Manhattan. I loved the location, safe, clean and the homes in the area were beautiful. We walked to the Late Show on Broadway, Time Square, Theatre District and Central Park. The Subway was close, 59Th & Lexington, rode the 6 (green line) to downtown, SOHO, Little Italy, China Town and Greenwich Village, it was raining and we managed just fine.\u000aThe staff was accommodating and just fabulous! The daily Breakfast was delish, choice of cerals, croissants & muffins, yogurt parfait and coffee. I agree the coffee machine in the main lobby was very impressives and made good coffee! A special THANK YOU to Krys and the gentleman who worked the front desk in the evening who spoke spanish, his pizza delivery recommendation was perfect. We really enjoyed that evening in with our toes up watching movies, eating pizza and drinking beer.\u000aI highly recommend you book this hotel if you want lots of space in your living area and a nice quite stay in NYC, it's feels like you're living in a NYC apt with a doorman.

Go to the left, where you'll find the check in desk and the most welcoming agent, and you'll be entertained during the check in process by the lovliest jazz music. Monday nights seem to be popping in the large, cozy lobby bar. Cool. Industrial. Welcoming. Kind of dark.\u000aWe went up 5 flights in the elevator to find our small, yet comfortable and CLEAN room. OH SO CLEAN. Stainless steel bathroom fixings. No tub, just a shower (low water pressure). Wonderful amenities. Keurig machine with kcups were in the room. Free bottled water. CVS is right across the street if you forget ANYTHING.\u000aLincoln Center and the 1 Train were a few blocks away. 15 minute train ride to 23rd street, and a few blocks walk to Chelsea piers. CONVENIENTLY LOCATED hotel on the West side.\u000aBed was so comfortable I got VERY good sleep. It is pretty high off of the floor on a platform, I had to jump up as a short person.\u000aA cab to midtown/times square was about $12.00

I did notice the table had dried ketchup on the top and unwashed stains on the wall in the bathroom. Also the opaque glass on the bathroom door needs to be thoroughly cleaned.\u000aWhen we booked, I thought I reserved a room with a view of the Memorial with a terrace. But we got the room with a kitchenette looking out over the construction. I think this mistake was made because we used TripAdvisor to book.The entire online process was very confusing. I had the copy of the booking from TripAdvisor, but the hotel said they didn't have the same information. We choose not to force the issue.

VMy stay at this hotel was very unpleasant. Before we even made it to our room there was a terrible odor in the hallways from the filthy carpeting. They were stained and smelled of old filth throughout the hotel. When we finally arrived to our room we were then terribly disappointed with what we saw, the room was incredibly smaller than what we expected and what was also advertised. The room was in bad shape, furniture was warn out, bathroom was terribly disgusting, lack of toiletries, overall appearance failed. There was rust all over the bathroom and the tub was disgusting. We had to wait for about an hour for hot water in the morning and the plastic behind the bathroom curtains were torn off, totally unkempt appearance overall. The room was extremely cold, after sleeping in a sweatsuit I decided to ask for a space heater which helped the room a bit... but still very cold due to the draft from the air conditioner in the window. Will not stay at this location again. Save your money and book elsewhere.

We had a great room on the 14th floor which was clean and had great blackout curtains. There was tea and coffee available in the lobby 24/7 and a great deli right next door if you were feeling hungry. The breakfast area was small, but there were trays available to take your food back to your room which we preferred.\u000aThere was only one slight negative - directly across the road is an Irish bar which had very loud music thumping until the small hours: take some ear plugs and you'll be fine!

The Warwick hotel is very smartly presented, and the staff were efficient and helpful. Our room was spaceous, quiet, and in pristine condition. The marble bathroom was impressive, and the room was fully featured (TV, internet, minibar, safe, iron, etc). The location of the hotel is very central and ideal for visiting central park and 5th avenue. Also, the hotel if very close to several subway stations if you want to travel elsewhere in Manhattan. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed staying in this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.\u000a

VAfter reading all the great reviews our expectations were high...\u000aFirstly everyone is right about the location! Far enough away from the hustle & bustle, but with great bars & restaurants on the doorstep..Close to the subway, and a walk to Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History.\u000aSecondly, as per nearly every visitor to The Lucerne has stated, the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.\u000aFinally, my first impression of the hotel was that it seemed a little dated, 'shabby chic' maybe kinder... There is only a lobby area with several sofas & chairs, and personally, we really missed a bar/lounge area for a drink after a hard day's sightseeing. Nice Matin is just next door, but not quite the same as relaxing in your own hotel's bar.\u000aOur room was comfortably furnished, no hidden surprises... Was in keeping with the rest of the hotel's decor. The bathroom was spotlessly clean with a huge shower, the hairdryer was a little dated, (attached to the bathroom wall), with not much strength to it!\u000aThe room had a mini fridge & microwave, and a rather nosey boxed aircon unit next to the window, luckily we didn't need to use it too much! Also an iron & ironing board, which came in very useful.\u000aYou were given a discount voucher to use for breakfast at Nice Matin's, but there are plenty of other eateries nearby that are much cheaper.\u000aIn conclusion, you get what you pay for at The Lucerne... It really is a great 'base' in which to 'crash' at the end of a busy day...\u000aNo doubt if you have children or you don't want to be eating out every evening, then you could use your room, with its microwave and fridge etc as a mini apartment, hence no need for the bar/lounge area. We had a pleasant stay, but will probably try another hotel with more amenities and maybe a view for our next New York adventure.

VRecently visited NYC with a friend to take in the sights and sounds. Having grown up in the Bronx, I was a bit more reticent than my friend to do the sightseeing. The World Center Hotel was a high point of the trip for me just under the phenomenal performance of Brian Culbertson at BB Kings Club in Times Square!\u000aCheck in was fast and courteous. Front desk even accommodated our request for a room that viewed the Freedom Tower and WTC fountains. The room was clean and comfortable with a fridge/wetbar. Easy access to subway and walking distance to Wall Street and Battery Park/Statue of Liberty.\u000a"BUT" , I was must stay true to my review on Trip Advisor as I really appreciate the reviews that others provide to making informed travel decisions. The only shade that I must throw is directed at housekeeping which showed up a little late each day. I like to get out early and return late afternoon to get cleaned up. Shouldn't have to hunt down hk for face towels.\u000aNonetheless, I can't endorse The World Center Hotel enough for an exceptional value in a city known for expensive accomodations. I would definitely stay here again!!

VWe found the Warwick met our needs very well for our family trip to NYC. The room was a bit small for the four of us, but the beds were super comfortable and the staff was always welcoming and friendly. The location was perfect. It was NOT in busy Times Square area, but it was handy to the subway system, shopping and close to Central Park. Loads of Deli's close by for late night snacking and dining. The only negative was no coffee maker in the room but I think that is standard for the older hotels now. Maybe a fire hazard or something. Stepping out to Starbucks was easy with 3 of them close by! All good. Would stay there again if looking for a quaint hotel atmosphere and not a big bustling lobby full of action like the Hilton across the street.

VStayed for a girls' long weekend and did a lot of research before booking the Warwick which, for our price range, seemed to offer the best quality and value. Room was spacious and clean on 20th floor. Beds very comfy and overall the room is quiet (with the exception of the aircon which is very noisy and you would need on all the time in the middle of summer I would guess). Given free wifi when we asked for it - would not have paid for it as it was flaky. As others have said, great location between 5th and 6th Avenues and easy access to many of the top attractions including ESB, Top of the Rock, Radio City, MOMA, etc. Did not eat here as the breakfast price seemed extortionate and found a great coffee shop one block away (Zibettos) and a great deli (53rd Street Deli). Drinks prices also very steep and given the alternatives so close by cannot understand why they are not more competitive. Staff helpful and friendly.\u000aI have not given 5 stars for the following reasons:\u000aWas offered an upgrade the day before we arrived for $30 a night extra which I took but when we checked in (4.30 in the afternoon) were given the wrong room and had to wait an hour for ours to be cleaned.\u000aNo coffee or tea making facilities in the room which they did provide when we asked for it on the first day but the supplies were not replenished, which we had to keep asking housekeeping for, or the cups cleaned. Seems a bit mean and odd.\u000aA bit dated in places and could do with a spruce up as far as the décor is concerned.\u000aCharging for local calls is a bit much.\u000aOverall though a great stay and would recommend.

VWell it's a mixed honest review. We stayed for 5 nights and as I didn't pay a lot as got a great deal so went with an open mind. Hotel location is amazing and a nice surprise as we trained it from Newark to walk out Penn st and see the hotel right across the road.. check in for us wasn't too bad maybe 15 in front but at times the queue was out the door.. I had emailed hotel a few times as read bad reviews and wanted to maybe speak of upgrade. Explained at check in and said I had read floor 2 good etc.. woman no floor 2 not good. Got floor 10 asked for non smoking, went to room omg it stank of stale smoke.. no way I could have stayed there. No view from window nothing. Straight down to reception and spike to george who was very nice and changed room with no problem and even said check it and still not satisfied come back down. Room was on 15th floor with view of ESB which was nice.. rooms are dated and most definitely need an upgrade. While checking the room I met our lovely maid who chatted away. Some of the staff are a bit rude but hey I didn't let them spoil my trip. The coffee shop in the lobby is very handy and pastries and coffee is lovely.\u000aToo from me is book at Penn 500 room if you can afford. If like me you get a cheap deal then don't settle for first room if your unhappy.\u000aIm not going to say i won't stay here again because if I get another deal I probably would.\u000aYour hardly in you room

VThis is a beautiful old hotel with loads of character in a fantastic location. My wife and I stayed at the Warwick between the 6th and 10th of May for our Silver Wedding. The hotel staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful and we were allocated a lovely room on the 22nd floor with a view over the junction of 54th Street and 6th Avenue. The room was large (for New York standards) and beautifully appointed with a modern refurbished bathroom. The location is great, just a couple of blocks from both Central Park and Broadway, close enough for visiting but far enough away to escape the madness of Times Square. We had breakfast in the hotel each morning, which was great quality and a plentiful, varied start to a day's sightseeing. I have been to New York regularly and this hotel is without doubt the best I have stayed. The staff really made us both feel very special. Trust me, for a New York hotel this is a fantastic choice, good value and was absolutely faultless.

VI have stayed here once before in 2000 and whilst I was impressed in 2000 I was really quite disappointed in 2015. The 2 bedroom suite was adequate but the bathrooms in the two bedrooms were very cramped. The windows were extremely draughty with quite a gale blowing through. When I stayed there in 2000 there was a toilet/shower off the living area but this time these were restricted to the two bedrooms. As I was there with my family, I slept on the bed settee in the lounge and short of disturbing the occupants of one of the bedrooms in the night I had no direct access to a toilet which is not ideal. Over the last decade or so I have stayed in the upper part of Manhattan which I prefer.

We discovered the Morton-Williams grocery store just up the block, it has a buffet for purchasing hot cooked food items and salads. This came in very handy because there are no cooking facilities in the room like a typical timeshare, only a small fridge and Kuerig coffee maker. This was more like a hotel room than a timeshare. The bed was a king and very comfy. The bathroom had a nice shower with overhead and hand held wand, a tub would have been nice. There are no other amenities at this location, no gym, no spa, no pool. no hot tub. I understand there is an owners lounge but we were not invited to partake, probably just as well since we don't like to eat a lot of carbs and sugary pastries etc for breakfast.\u000aVery convenient location to walk to Central Park or Times Square, and attend Broadway shows.

VMy wife and I stayed in this hotel for seven days in the middle of December 2012 from Sunday to Sunday. From the airport transportation I made reserved through the hotel to the room doors that did not lock to the PPV movie system that did not work this hotel is a mess.\u000aI received an email about great 50% off deals through the hotels website. I booked an airport transfer and it read they have the reservation will be in touch. Nothing.\u000aI had to book a shuttle and wait almost an hour.\u000aWhen I checked in I asked for a high floor and a King bed, which the agent smiled and said no problem. The 9th floor is not high at all and I got two twin beds right by the elevator, which I was too tired to go down and argue about. The agent also said he was going to slip some drink coupons under the door which never happened. The safety lock on the room was also broken off and the door did not lock. We did not sleep all night due to traffic noise.\u000aThe staff was able to move me to a higher room on the 21st floor two days later which was much quieter. No King bed available (even though they had availability online) due to overbooking. This room the PPV did not work and the door did not lock / latch properly. We even came back to the room after house cleaning went in and the door was unlocked!\u000aThe staff said they would send someone up to fix the lock and the PPV system repeatedly for about 2-3 days. Every other day the room key did not work and we had to go down and get a new one.\u000aWhen I asked about the airport transfer I booked, the agent at the front desk gave me a blank stare. He then mentioned it was probably booked through the concierge. Too bad he did not work today though. On a Sunday? Come back tomorrow morning and ask I was told. Well guess what? He did not work Monday either!\u000aWhen I did finally ask about it on Tuesday, the concierge was lost as expected. He made me feel like I made it up and I had to show him the email offer for the specials (which came from the GM by the way) and how to book it via the home web page.\u000aHe said it must have gotten lost. He said he would contact the GM and the manager and see what they could do for me and let me know. He felt very bad and was very nice with good follow up, mentioning he would call them every 10 minutes. He finally spoke with them and he told me there was nothing they could do, so sorry.\u000aI also waited till the concierge was available to buy Empire State Building tickets. What hotel has a concierge that has Monday and Sunday off and works strange hours? Like off at 3 or 4?When I bought the 2 tickets to the Empire State building I thought they were discounted until I got it and saw they were the same price.\u000aThe food in the bar is is not very good either.\u000aI would have moved from the hotel when told there were no King beds on Wednesday if I could have found another hotel with availability and a somewhat reasonable price, but they were all booked.

VSometimes good things start off funny. In this case, the hotel didn't have our room ready when we arrived. They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine along with snacks in their lobby. Another bottle of wine in the room. And a room upgrade. That's how to run a hotel.\u000aThis hotel is nicely located between Soho (shopping, of course) and Times Square, right on Park Ave. and, if you don't like cabs, 2 blocks from the 28th street subway stop.\u000aThe rooms are very tastefully decorated and also clean. Room service for breakfast is complimentary ($5 delivery charge per person) and really very good. Also, it's delivered in 10 minutes or less.\u000aWe got back to the hotel one evening at 6 ready to go to dinner and found cheese, crackers, crudites and other good things...and free wine again. They even have a pianist playing a Yamaha baby grand.\u000aWe could not have been happier with this hotel. It's our new favorite.

VThis is a nice hotel, but nothing special in comparison to other Kimpton's, especially in NYC. The rooftop, WHEN you are able to get to it (is often closed for private events), is lovely and has a great view, but can be filled with a lot of European attitude. Please note: The staff won't tell you this until you ask, but the red ropes are 'typically' there just to form a line--guests are 'typically' allowed to show their room key and go directly up. The red ropes do not 'typically' mean the roof is closed for a private event. Again, none of this is explained at check-in.\u000aAt check-in, we were asked to provide a card for incidentals (typical), but they used that card to charge the entire bill. Have to complete a form to have the charges reversed. Very inconvenient and misleading.\u000aAlso, there appears to be a variation of room prep for Kimpton Karma reward holders. Some people get champagne, others do not. The hand-written cards were a nice touch. Again, however, some of those cards made it up to the room prior to check-in, others were handed out at the front desk. Just no consistency.\u000aOther than that, it's a nice hotel. Again, nothing special (artwork is the same on every floor), but they do try to give that extra special touch at times--they just need to learn to be consistent. The location is great for us (we like Hell's Kitchen), but there are FAR better Kimpton's in NYC where you will get a better value for your money!

VMy wife and I stayed at this hotel from Jan 1 - Jan 6 and were very impressed. I was surprised to find this deal in Midtown; we only paid $124 a night (including taxes). The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the 28th or 33rd St. 6 train stations and a 10 minute walk from the 28th St. N/R train station. This made getting to all attractions (WTC, Times Square, Battery Park for Statue of Liberty, UWS for Natural History Museum) very easy, about 30 minutes away. There are also several restaurants within a 5 minute walk, making quick eating very nice.\u000aWhile the room was tight, that is to be expected in Manhattan. The room had everything we needed. Wifi and TV worked well (thought some stations were hard to get), as did the heater (very important as we are from Florida). We stayed on the 10th floor and had a nice view of both the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The complimentary breakfast was basic but meet our expectations for a hotel breakfast. Every morning there was juice, milk, bagels, muffins, cereal, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, bananas, apples, and more. Nothing extravagant, but enough to energize you to start your day. There was some noise at night, but that again is to be expected in Midtown Manhattan.\u000aI'd definitely recommend this hotel and would return in future trips to NYC. The staff wasn't overly friendly but they definitely weren't rude.\u000aCab from JFK was about 40 minutes (on a Friday night), and our cab to LaGuardia was about 20 minutes (on a Wednesday morning). It was very easy to get a cab on Lexington (the street the hotel is on).

The staff has obviously been trained. They also were more than happy to give directions suggestions etc. Really impressive.\u000aGot a room with 2 double beds. Size was like a normal hotel room size, not maybe by Las Vegas standards, but had no problems at all. Free DSL in the room! A coffeemaker! A hotel that doesn't nickel and dime you to death! Comfortable bed, nice bathroom. Only a few small cons: Room is really dark, they should lighten it up, not much shelf/counter space in the bathroom and also you can hear the traffic on 7th if you are trying to sleep on a busy night. Small points, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Lots of bars restaurants in the area, EASY to get down town or midtown if it's good walking weather.

Not what I would expect from this class of property. I stayed at NY Palace on Madison last year also a 5 star property. Far superior so if you are considering I would recommend the Palace over this property.\u000aAs a recent review said the front desk were not helpful and with all staff we came across their customer service training needs to be refreshed.

VNeil & Carrie Dec 2015 (visiting from Hull, England)\u000aI was fortunate to stay at the Nylo for a 5 night Xmas break in mid December. From the moment we stepped foot out of the taxi and was met by the Nlyo staff we knew we had made the perfect choice. The entrance leads you through the very cool/chic bar and lounge area. Reception where extremely helpful when checking us in. We were lucky enough to be staying in the Penthouse Loft suite which has an amazing view over the Hudson River. The room itself was spacious and well resourced, the bed was unbelievably comfortable which is perfect after a long day exploring New York City. The hotel is located 2mins walk to a subway station OR a scenic 5minute walk to Central Park (not far from the Dakota building). We enjoyed cocktails and beers at the bar every night, and enjoyed the live music that was being played. We also recommend a visit the Amsterdam Ale house which is 1 minute walk away.\u000aThe staff at the Nylo are always around to help you, always courteous to your needs, and ensure you have a fantastic stay.\u000aWe enjoyed breakfast in the Serifina restaurant most mornings (eggs benedict were superb). This set us up nicely for the rest of the day.\u000aMatthew (general manager) really made our stay memorable from start to finish for which myself and my fiancée will be forever grateful. We cannot wait to come back to New York again and will definitely be staying at the Nylo. We would strongly recommend the Nylo to everyone whose planning a visit to NYC in the near future.\u000aMany thanks to all at the Nylo, a trip we will never forget.\u000aNeil and Carrie x

I never waited more than an hour for a response to any question that arose. When the weekend finally came, every detail was handled perfectly, last minute requests greeted with enthusiasm and mistakes (mine, not theirs) absorbed and corrected immediately. The entire staff gave the impression they were as anxious to make this wedding a success as we were. The guests fell in love with the physical property as well, many of them saying it felt like being in our home. And, of course, the rooftop bar with its spectacular views was a big hit.

It is an old print shop converted to hotel. Really fun atmosphere. The bar/lounge on first floor flows into lobby with large comfortable chairs and couches; Staff at front desk very friendly. The one aspect of this hotel that really was great was the lounge on the roof of the hotel. Great views, lively and quite a bit of fun. We had just wished we had not waited until the end of the night to find this great hang out spot. If I did not like trying new places I would definitely stay here again. I do recommend for people to try. Only down side was that immediately outside the hotel there were not a ton of places to go except car dealerships.

Lovely hotel, comfortable and stylish room on the 8th floor looking partially into Times Square. But not noisy, not too bright, and definitely worth asking for a room overlooking the square. Brilliant location for doing all the sights, easy access to the subway, places to eat, Broadway shows, the lot. Would highly recommend this hotel but if there are 2 of you try not to get a queen-sized bed, what is it with America that thinks 2 of you can get a decent night's sleep in such a small bed?

And you can open the windows a bit for air (or go out on the terrace if you have one). They also have a gym.\u000aIt's a very old building, but beautifully renovated. Comfy beds, spacious rooms, great bathrooms and a workable kitchen. Ask for a kettle and toaster on check-in if you need them.\u000aEasy walk to the Penn Station, Macy's, food, shopping and Empire State. Don't miss the Morgan Library (also an easy walk away) if you want a change of pace.\u000aWe took the subway downtown from here and it was very easy.\u000aAlso close to a great medical centre (hopefully you'll never need it but we did, and the staff were great recommending help for a sick member of our party).\u000aLots of small places to eat locally with fresh food options, or try the Stage Door diner near the post office. Great food and service within walking distance.\u000aIf you can, get a room with a terrace. We were there in winter but it was still great to out on the terrace and watch the city. And the gorgeous St Francis church across the road is worth a look - the mosaics are outstanding and they have a very moving 9/11 memorial.\u000aHighly recommended.

VFirst arrived and a bellman carried our bags up the first flight of stairs. Checked in and got upgraded for some reason to a queen room. Reception staff were friendly and helpful and always said hello whenever you walked by. Got to the room which was 33. Not a lot of floor space. Wondered what the double rooms were like as the queen wasn't massive. Very clean room and bathroom and bed was very comfy. Room was warm but there was a ceiling fan to help. Don't think the AC did a lot. Didn't know why people are complaining about ripped carpets etc. unless we got one of the better rooms. Couldn't ask for a better hotel on this budget in New York. We really enjoyed our stay and had no problems. Great that the subway is pretty much outside the door. The store a couple of buildings up is handy too and is open 24/7. The room was cleaned every morning and they did a good job. The corridors where always tidy aswell.\u000aThe wifi stopped working after the second day. But it seemed they changed the password, which would have been why it didn't work. But standing outside Starbucks or mcdonalds does the trick.\u000aFor a place to shower and sleep it's perfect.

VFor a very reasonable price, this hotel gives you great location, lots of service, and clean, trendy rooms. You are on upper Broadway, a few blocks above Lincoln Center and nearby Columbus Circle, and you are only a couple of blocks over from the Museum of Natural History, the New York HIstorical Society, and all of Central Park. There are lots of good restaurants nearby, and a couple of really great ones, all that you could walk to (maybe take a cab back). There seem to be more bellman, doormen, and concierges around affirmatively helping you than in many of the top, pricy hotels. Not sure how they manage to do it. The rooms themselves are quite nice, although decor is aggressively modern - engineered grey wood plank floors, faux-cork wallpaper, stainless steel unified sink structure, metal locker nightstands, and so forth. We found all this appealing: faux-wood floors are in many ways nicer than carpets where a thousand feet "have trod, have trod \u2026"

The nicest part of hotel is the lobby lots of money spent there but no where else. Outdated rooms and furnishings and rooms look beat up. Everytime i go out door keys dont work. Outside of doors look beat up..hallway is dreary and just yukie

VWe stayed in the Hotel Metro for five nights on our first trip to NYC.\u000aThe location is fantastic- within walking distance from the Empire State, Macy's, Times Square and several subway stations.\u000aWe booked a standard room which was fine for two of us with all the amenities you need, including hair drier, ipod dock, TV etc. Bathroom is clean and well stocked with toiletries. We were also pleasantly surprised by the fact that our sheets and towels were changed every day by the maid.\u000aWe were on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel which overlooked a road and a building site. It was very noisy at night but we fully expected it to be- this is New York after all!\u000aThe hotel itself is very pleasant, particularly the lobby and breakfast room which have a very warm and welcoming feel. Frank Sinatra music is also being piped out almost constantly, creating a very old New York atmosphere!\u000aThe complimentary continental breakfast is excellent (toast, cereal, granola, pastries, muffins, assorted bagels, jams, yogurts, cheeses, fruit), although the earlier you go the busier it can get. Unlike previous reviewers on here, we found the selection to be wide and there was plenty of food available even when we came down to breakfast late one morning. The free tea and coffee which is available throughout the day and evening is also a bonus.\u000aWe ate in the hotel restaurant, the Metro Grill on a couple of nights which was fine and is very convenient when you've been out all day and come back late and tired. It may be a little more expensive than other places but unless you want to catch a cab/subway somewhere or eat fast food, decent places for dinner nearby the hotel are few and far between.\u000aThe roof garden bar is also an added bonus. It is expensive and can get very busy at night but there's a fantastic view of the Empire State building and it's a great place to take photos.\u000aOur trip was unfortunately marred by the fact that on the saturday night before we were due to leave we were both struck by severe food poisoning. The only thing we had both eaten was a sandwich we had shared from a deli at the end of the road. Although the hotel by and large were accomodating, one member of staff was very difficult and unhelpful during this experience.\u000aWe were both so ill we were unable to leave our room or take our airport transfer for our flight home. We rang down to reception to inform them of this and to arrange to stay at the hotel for another night, which they were fine about and gave us a good rate.\u000aHowever, when we asked to see a doctor the man on reception told us this wasn't a good idea and said he would instead get us a cab to go to the medical centre. He seemed to have a real issue with getting a doctor to come to the hotel and wouldn't accept that neither of us could get out of bed let alone get in a cab.\u000aLater when I rang downstairs to ask for some water to be sent to our room, the same man told us this wasn't possible as the restaurant wouldn't be open for another half an hour and that I would have to come downstairs to get some then. He also said he needed me to come to the front desk to sign a piece of paper confirming we would be staying another night- again he couldn't seem to appreciate that neither of us could venture away from our bathroom! Having rang to see a doctor at eleven in the morning, we were eventually visited at half past ten at night.\u000aThis was just a very unfortunate turn of events and it certainly didn't put us off the hotel. The next day a different member of staff was on shift and was very helpful in rearranging transfers for us and sorting out our bill.\u000aDespite our last day, we had a fantastic time in NYC and will certainly be going back and would gladly stay at this hotel again- although I think we'll be avoiding any delis!

VMy husband and 2 young boys enjoyed our recent overnight at NYLO. Almost completely positive. Staff was unilaterally friendly and helpful. We used the valet parking and would recommend highly. 55.00 to park for 24 hours is a much cheaper option for a family than train (or even bus), plus you can bring with you more of the comforts of home. Close to everything we needed - Beacon Theatre, Central Park, Museum of Natural History, and many family-friendly restaurants.\u000aWe were offered free WiFi upon arrival, and all of us happily partook in our downtime (which was pretty minimal).\u000aBeds are big and supremely comfortable! Standard rooms, although not huge, were large by NYC standards and fine for our needs.\u000aThere are two beautiful outdoor porches with amazing views of the City. Unfortunately, both were out of commission during our stay.\u000aBlackout curtains worked well to minimize both light and outside noise.\u000aThe only thing preventing me from giving NYLO 4 stars is that apparently, the walls are paper-thin.. at least, on the sixth floor where we were. In the bathroom, I could hear every word of a conversation happening downstairs (though I tried hard not to). And we were 'chided' for being too loud and were trying not to speak above a whisper. No fun with two boys in a small room. This one thing, unfortunately, is kind of a big deal, and possibly, for us in the future, a deal-breaker.

VBooked a king size room. Had an amazing time. The street view was great. Only draw back was the 6:00 AM jackhammer across the street. Can't blame the hotel on that one.\u000aThe room was beautiful, and the bed was nice and comfortable. There was a decent sitting area, with a desk. There were 2 cordless phones in the room, but we had an issue with not being able to check messages. No problem, as the front desk allowed us to use their phone to check.\u000aOnly other "issue," and I hate calling it that, was the difficulty we had finding the hair dryer. There was one in the room, but it was in a drawer we wouldn't have thought to look in. In fact, the front desk clerk gave me 5 different drawers it could be in.\u000aAll in all, it was a WONDERFUL stay. The staff was kind and courteous. The rooms and lobby were beautiful, and the location was amazing. Literally in the shadow of the Empire State Building.\u000a

VWe stayed in a corner room in floor 27, the view was fantastic. True, it is quite expensive. We spent nearly 4,000 for 7 nights, however its worth the money. The location is just perfect; just a couple blocks from time square it is the perfect starting point to explore Manhattan. Located in the same street you find the theather hosting The Lion King, Mamma Mia, Matilda, The Phantom of the Opera and other shows. A subway entrance is located just next to the main door, and lets face it the NY subway is an experience you want to have while visiting the city. The room is small but really nice with all the amenities you would expect in a 5 stars hotel. The only thing I would change was the TV, it was placed right in front of the window blocking most of the breath taking view. Other than that it was perfect. The concierge helped us making some reservations for tours and she was really nice. We didn´t get to visit the pool and spa since we were too busy exploring and having fun.

VThe Affinia is one of my go-to locations any time I'm staying in NYC for business. It's ideally located if you're taking a train into Penn Station or for any mid-town connections.\u000aI stayed here with my family to celebrate my daughter's birthday and it worked out great. We could walk to see all the usual attractions near Time Square, Bryant Park, Flatiron district and even SOHO.\u000aThe hotel staff are generally friendly and helpful- especially the front desk staff. The lobby is inviting, bustling and there's plenty of room for groups to sit and talk.\u000aFor the price, I haven't found even a few other hotels that have better value, for the location. If you can book 2-3 weeks in advance you'll usually pick up a good rate or take advantage of the many "specials" they run. It's not luxurious by any means but its clean, contemporary and has provided me consistently good experiences.\u000aA downside of the location is the noise. The traffic (complete w/ horns, sirens) along 7th Ave by Madison Square Garden is considerable, around the clock.

VThe Lucerne Hotel is a great hotel in a great location on the Upper West side. Our room on the 9th floor was perfect for our family. It had a small living room and then a separate sleeping area. The mini fridge was helpful too. The room was very clean, right down to the inside of the drawers. The bathroom was small but we appreciated the many towel hooks and the great pressure in the shower. We had requested non-feather pillows and that was taken care of before we checked in. And when we needed a few extra towels, they were brought up to our room immediately. Having access to the 1 train (the red line) of the subway just one block away was very convenient. The hotel's restaurant, Nice Matin, was delicious for breakfast/brunch and hotel guests receive a 15% off coupon to dine there. The hotel was perfect for our needs and we'll be sure to stay there again when we are back in New York City.

Don't forget to ask for the room in a high floor facing east or a corner room. You will be shocked by the gorgeous and spectacular skyline either on daytime or at night. Don't touch the food and drink in mini bar and the wine on the plate under the television. That is an automatic charging system. If you touch and you do not consume, you need to mention that when you check out to avoid incorrect charge.

VI was in New York for five days to deliver my son to college. My sister came up from New Orleans so that we could have some fun in the city. The staff at Giraffe--mostly a group of very affable young men--were welcoming and helpful. Our double bedded room was BIG by New York standards, the furnishings were modern by warm, beds comfy and the bathroom very nice-sized with nice toiletries. Loved the bath robes. Really, really loved the fact that there was almost always a little something to drink or snack on in the lobby. Made it feel so comfortable and personal. Just a wonderful, easy place to be in New York.

VWe stayed at hotel Giraffe for our first wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right decision. We were welcomed by very friendly staff that couldn't do enough for us. We checked in and got to the room and it's was perfect a short while later we had a knock at the door with an anniversary card from the hotel and a complimentary bottle of wine. Which just put a huge smile on our faces. We headed into town and arrived back just in time to sample the complementary wine and cheese boards. The Persecco kept coming as soon as our glass was empty it was topped back up and the cheese boards and snacks were just enough to tie us over until our evening meal out. The breakfast at the hotel was also a great addition serving classic New York bagels and croissant's fresh from a bakery as well as the usual cereals and fruit. The icing on the cake for us was the fact they supplied gluten free as well this made my wife's trip. For our anniversary meal we asked the staff to recommend somewhere which they did and it was amazing and only 200 yards away. When we got back from our meal I had ordered a dozen red roses and a bottle of Persecco when I booked and these had been places in the room and they'd taken the time to place some of the petals on the bed which looked great. We can't recommend staying here enough and will be back in the future.

VStayed for 5 nights during November. The hotel occupies floors 1-6 of an old tennament building on the uptown section of Broadway. The ground floor is shops and a Starbucks which was great for caffeine fixes! The staff fully deserve a mention for their hospitality, customer service and general manners. We had a wedding and the hotel.was excellent with support for flowers, advice, saloons etc. The rooms are basic with bedside tables, dressing table, flat screen telly and a small hanging rail unit. The beds were very comfortable. The ensuite was small however very clean and perfectly functional. I'm not fazed by stair climbing however I noticed a few people unhappy without a lift. The building is very old and like many places (pubs/shops) the age of the building won't accommodate a lift easily!! Again, the staff were only too happy to find rooms to suit individual requests however I would advise anyone with mobility issues to appreciate the access from the street to the reception is via a flight of stairs. The hotel has a colourful lobby which you can bring refreshments to. There is no vending machine, restaurant or cafe at this hotel. The location is great for access routes to the bus and subway. Bus stop is directly out front with 93rd street subway literally a stone throw from the hotel. The '1' train is a local line which stops at all routes, it's approximately 30 minutes train ride to Wall Street. For the express trains '2' & '3' you need to walk to 96th street station which is 10 minutes, these train only stop periodically so get down town much quicker. Central Park is a short 10 minute walk, take the first left heading downtown and straight line it! This is a nice section if you have kids, there is a new playground.

VMy daughter and I have stayed at the Warwick on three occasions, all during the holiday season. The hotel is lovely, in a wonderful neighborhood close to many attractions. I got a very good deal on Priceline all three times, around $170 (including tax) December 2012. On our way to the airport, another guest in the shuttle told us that she stays regularly and will call the hotel directly for the same special rate.\u000aThe hotel rooms are well appointed. It is well-established, and well-maintained. The hotel just puts us in a good mood.\u000aThe breakfast buffet is not included in "special deals," and neither is free wi-fi. We had the buffet our first morning because it was cold outside and we didn't know yet what was in the neighborhood. Later we discovered 2 Starbucks on the next block (with free wifi) and many restaurants serving breakfast, as well as a small grocery store a few minutes walk away.

VI needed to make a quick trip to NYC on my own dime with just an overnight stay, and I could find few options under $300/night. I took a chance on St. Mark's, because it was walking distance (20 min.) to Cherry Lane Theatre, the site of my evening commitment... and it didn't break the bank. On the positive side, the staff was friendly, the location wonderful, and the the place clean. My single had a double bed with double-pane window and an adequate private bathroom; plus room was probably 10'X20'--certainly better than the trendy Jane Hotel with it's tiny single-bed bunk rooms with shared baths. AND it was $140/night incl. taxes! On the negative side: no elevator, cash payment required, cheap beds and linens, absolutely no frills with carpet stains.There was a wall-mounted TV with enough cable options, but the TV only faced down from the wall-mount. Other than the bed, there was a shelving unit and a wooden chair--that's it. The small radiator could not be controlled and it became too warm, so I opened the window a crack, which let in mosquitoes (in December!) from the courtyard area. Would I stay here again?... probably not, but have no regrets about choosing it this time. Most of the other guests seemed to be older budget travelers--not undesirables that you'd expect at a flophouse.

She listened to what we had to say and delivered an amazing evening reception for us. The room are very clean and the pillows were so comfortable, I definitely slept well, just what was needed leading up to the wedding. I would definitely stay here again and seek out the other Kimpton Hotels in the USA. It is a small walk to Times Square and Central Park. I am not keen on staying in the thick of it, Ink was quiet and you still got amazing views.

Sophia was very helpful and was just a genuinely nice person. I told her that my two kids were excited because they were having a birthday and we had traveled from San Diego to take them to a Blackeyed Peas concert (the concert was eventually canceled due to weather). She asked me for their names. I didn't think much of it. She gave us a great room with an awesome view. The room was very well appointed and had a very nice bathroom.\u000aThe hotel is very centrally located. It is only two blocks from Time Square. There are also great restaurants in the area. The subway is right at the corner. After a great day in New York, we returned to our room and were surprised to find two small birthday cakes for my now 8 and 11 year old kids. They have won me over in a big way and will recommend this hotel to everyone I know.\u000aI have stayed at great hotels all over the world but I have never had this kind of personal service. It really made my trip to see the look on my kids face when they walked into the room and saw the cakes. It really is the simple things that make the greatest difference. Thanks Sophia!

VThis hotel is part of a small chain and having stayed in another hotel in the chain before I knew the service would be good and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is I'm midtown and as such gives you access to all of Manhattan with relative ease. The rooms are spacious for a big city and very clean. The service in general is excellent and the concierges are very knowledgeable. The breakfast and snacks throughout the day are excellent and the quality of the cheese and wines in the evening is good. This is a great hotel if you want to be a little further away from Times Square and everyday tourist trail. There is an great rooftop space to enjoy the views with a hot chocolate. An excellent place to stay. One negative whilst we were there was that one of the lifts wasn't working but I can't take a point off for that as everything else was great and sometimes these things can't be helped.

They gave me a room which was totally not what i had originally booked and paid for explaining that hotel is fully booked & this is the last available room whereas i could see 50 people checking in after me..\u000aThe bathroom had leaking shower broken sink, room had peeling roofs, non functional heaters.. a complete nightmare.. after my repeated requests to change the room only assistance they provided me was to sent a plumber to my room to fix the leaking shower. He told me his shift is about to get over and hence it will be fixed only next morning.. Inspite of this level of service he wanted me to tip him & left my room rudely since i decided not to give any tips..\u000aI could not sleep all night cos of loud noise in the bathroom from leaking shower.. At 2 am in the night i called for manager & a solution to my problem.. He replied saying they can check me out right now & refund my money & i can go & find any other hotel in NYC where i could sleep peacefully.. He will change my room early morning next day..\u000aNext day i go to front desk after cancelling all my meetings asking for a room change so that i could rest for a while before starting my day nd the staff replied that they not be able to change my room before 1 PM.. That was my dipping point & decided to check out ( I had booked non refundable room) & asked for a refund. The hotel denied that as well..\u000aIn summary, my stay was both a mental & financial torture.. Will strongly NEVER RECOMMEND this sub standard hotel to anybody..

VWe stayed for 3 nights and here is what I gathered (see noted below). One of the taxi drivers told me that this place used to be a hostel so you can guess what this motel is like.\u000aPro:\u000a- The location is ok (upper west side) and it is very close to a subway station.\u000a- Next to a Starbucks\u000a- Walking distance to the central park\u000a- Walking distance to a few small grocery stores\u000a- Housekeeping service daily\u000a- Cheap taxi rides from Time Square to the hotel, roughly $12 to $14.\u000a- A small but working air condition unit\u000a- Relatively clean, but you can tell the housekeeping folks do miss a few spots (or it may be the stains, etc).\u000aCon:\u000a- Very thin wall, you can hear what is going on outside, downstairs, upstairs, next doors, etc.\u000a- No heater (will be an issue if stay during the winter time)\u000a- No remote for the TV\u000a- No closet space, there is a rack right next to the door that has a few hangers.\u000a- Don't expect the typical stuff you get from a hotel (room service, ironer, TV remote)\u000a- Small bathroom (a few minor things - shower doesn't work really hard - hard to adjust water temperatures, a few tiles in the shower were replaced ( you can totally tell, it's a different color), one of the bath towels provided was torn and has a hole in it)\u000aMy conclusion - It's a motel, not a hotel. Don't expect much.\u000aNote: After tax, I paid roughly $270 a night for 3 nights.

VThis is one of the nicest hotel rooms i've ever stayed in. Awesome views of the skyline, a huge room, a huge soaking tub in the middle of the room with Aveda bath salts. Great, big shower with both a rain-showerhead and a moveable/removeable showerhead on a hose. Great friendly service all around, including a prompt visit to refill the previously mentioned bath salts when i wanted another bath.\u000aThe afternoon wine reception and morning coffee/tea are nice touches.\u000aThe rooftop bar has spectacular views, though the drinks are incredibly expensive, even by Manhattan standards.\u000aThe star off is only because of the location, which is several blocks from pretty much anything, so if you have bags and aren't young and mobile, this could be a problem. There is also really no transit service nearby, but cabs are cheap in NYC and it's a ten-minute walk to Times Square.

VThis is a very strange hotel. Upon arrival you are greeted by a receptionist staring at a computer, housed in a hole in the wall that is the sum total of 'reception'. I really did feel sorry for them not being allowed to sit down all day. We were shown to a well appointed large room on the 3rd floor overlooking a quiet courtyard. A big plus is that the windows opened easily but there is no air conditioning only very noisy heating. The bed was a bit on the soft side but comfortable. Very little storage space as the room is full of vintage furniture without drawers. The bathroom is old fashioned and lacked adequate lighting or a make up mirror. There are no services to speak of so it is bit like staying in a rented room rather than a hotel. The small lobby houses a public coffee bar with free wifi so any seating is constantly taken up by locals with their dogs who stay for hours. This is extremely annoying and it is like staying in a branch of Starbucks. There is no dining room but the hotel is very near restaurants, diners and Chelsea Market and a 24 hour drugstore. Bus stops right outside but subway (23rd street) is a 15 minute walk. No manager to be seen but Daniel in reception was extremely helpful. Try the excellent lunch at Del Posto - 5 minutes walk.

This boutique hotel is stylishly decorated throughout without being over the top.\u000aThe bar and restaurant, were an added bonus. Nothing more enjoyable after a busy day out in New York to then return to your hotel for a glass of wine or cocktail.\u000aThe location is perfect. Walking distance to all the attractions uptown and downtown and with the subway literally around the corner, you really couldn\u2019t ask for more!\u000aI would say if you are looking for a hotel that offers high standard at a good price, helpful staff, with good rooms.

VWE stayed here over Christmas. We had a suite for our family of 4 , with 2 teenage daughters- plenty of room , nicely furnished, quiet , 2 tvs so no arguments, nice bathroom. The only difficulty was that the sofabeds are not very comfortable , so our girls felt they had to put up with this all week. We requested another matress to put on top but this did not arrive.\u000aApart from that, we all loved this hotel - very relaxed, the buffet breakfast was just right for our needs , enough variety and very flexible, with eggs, cereals , lovely breads etc. Tea and coffee, biscuits and wine/cheese in the evening available free, made for a casual welcoming atmosphere, with no sense that 'it cost money to breathe' as you get in many large formal hotels. The computer in the lobby is very useful. This hotel was not cheap but is good value, especially considering breakfast is included. The staff were friendly and helpful. There are many good restaurants nearby and from this location it is easy to get anywhere in Manhatten.\u000aI would recommend the mexican restaurant next door - the margueritasare very good.

VI cannot 'rave' about this hotel enough! The moment you walk through the door you feel comfortable. The staff are extremely professional and are happy to help with anything. We ended up extending our stay and even though the hotel was booked out initially they did their best to find us a room. The hotel describes itself as feeling more like someone's 'home' and that is exactly how it feels! There is such a warmth about it. The courtyard is nothing short of utterly beautiful. The drawing room is completely relaxing- especially with the log fire. They have used the space in the rooms well - I initially thought the rooms would be small but they are surprisingly large! The restaurant Locanda Verde is very good and has a great buzz. I will be returning to NY and this is the place I will go to.

VSo my wife and I were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary so we though we would spend a night in the city at a nice hotel.\u000aThe location is great I live in long Island and work in the city so know it really well.\u000aSo we get to our room very nice room at first glance.\u000aAfter taking a quick shower and getting ready for a nap. We jump into bed as soon as i get in i notice that there are some nasty brown stains on the covers and also some red and brown stains on the carpet. So I call down to the front desk they say they will send someone up. 30 mins later no one so i text the hotel also they say someone is coming up. 1 hour later I go to the lobby and they also tell me some one is coming up. After 2 hours the manger comes up and has them change the sheets and also tell me the stains in the carpet have been there for while and the carpet need to be changed. The room manger was very nice.\u000aSo now relaxing in the room I start to open the mini fridge and notice there is an empty bottle I call and let the front desk know. NOT a big issue but when paying almost $400 for a room you expect better. Now at 11;30 pm i was in the mood for a snack so I call room service place an order we are vegan so i told them to make it vegan. 12:00am i call to get an update on my order they say they never got my order but will bring it up now. So I get my food and take a bite and there is Sour cream in my food not vegan. So I call front desk and let them know and tell them not to send replacement and not to charge me for food I cant eat.\u000aI go to check out the next morning and they had charged me for room service food and had explain the issue again and they took off charge. The manger had said they would give me 15% credit for stay for all the issues but since i had prepaid reservation that couldn't be done. So they took off $30 charge we had made at the roof top. The roof top amazing. I excepted much better stay.

Then they offered a "non smoking room" on a smoking floor but when we checked one could easily smell the smoke inside the room. The receptionist confirmed that it had been a smoking room up until a few days previous. We asked to speak to the general manager but were advised he would not be on duty for a few days time but he would contact us on his return, needless to say we are still waiting.....

VThis hotel has a lot of pluses but some minuses. All in all, wasn't bad and I may return depending upon how long I will be in town. The location is just around the corner from my office so it was super convenient. If you get a room facing Rock Center it is very good. I would describe it as an efficiency hotel rather than a luxury boutique. The bed was great. The shower was nice. the Wifi as free (yeah!) and the staff was quite friendly. However, the room (even the upgrade in the front of the hotel) was quite small (like a small dorm room) and the biggest negative is that there is no restaurant or food in the hotel. you have to go next door even to have your breakfast. That may be what causes me to look elsewhere.

VWe stayed at the West 57th Street hotel for 2 nights. The room was beautiful, modern and clean. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. The bathroom, although only a shower (a large space with a rain shower head as well as a hand-held faucet), was large and clean. Our room, however, was on the street side and there was construction going on across the street and, being by a streetlight, there was a lot of stop and go traffic noise. The staff of the hotel were all very professional and polite. There was a breakfast but it was for owners only, not guests. I understand the owners also have a lounge with drinks and appetizers in the evening too.We did enjoy the free bottled water in our room. We had a small fridge and there was also a mini-bar (for a fee). For us, the location was perfect. Down the street was Carnegie Hall, Columbus Circle was within walking distance and Central Park was one block away. We really enjoyed our stay there but would definitely ask for a room on the opposite side next time as the street noise was very obvious and annoying.

VAlthough this hotel is Uptown from Manhattan, it was so easy to get Downtown on the Subway. The Subway felt so safe and it is truly just around the corner from the hotel and so cheap! My room on the 5th floor was great- large and very comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed. The ONLY downside was that I could hear the people in the room next door for a couple of the nights but I think they were exceptionably loud people anyway!! The concierge service was spot on- very helpful finding local shoe stores!! I was welcomed by all staff each time I came "home" after a busy day. The Nice Matin restaurant was my breakfast choice each day. There a plenty of dining choices for dinner in the area and as a lone diner, I felt comfortable. A bonus for me was that there was a Dry Cleaner and Launderer next door to the hotel and was a fraction of the cost of the hotel service. So in summary, a great hotel away from the mayhem of busy pre-Christmas New York.

They are by far the worst I have ever witnessed in my extensive travels around the world. It was too much trouble for them to raise their head to acknowledge your existence in the hotel, never mind a "Good Morning" or "Have a nice day". If you asked for any information like "Where is the best place to buy a Metro Card" they would grunt, shrug their shoulders and point out through the door.\u000aThe breakfast was until 10.00 am, at 09.50 am the doors were closed and all the food started to be removed, you were given the impression that breakfast FINISHES at 10.00am prompt.\u000aIf you want a cheap, very central hotel then this is fine, but if you want good polite service this is not the hotel for you.\u000aWould only stay here again if there was no other rooms available in the city!!\u000a

VReally enjoyed my stay at the World Center Hotel. Excellent room with a great view of the 9/11 Memorial. I stayed on the 10th floor and enjoyed superb views from that height--my photos from that level had some gorgeous detail of the memorial (day, night, sunrise) that I could not get from, say, the verandah of the very nice restaurant located on the top floor of the hotel. That vantage point was also charming...but different insofar as being able to juxtapose more of the details surrounding the two pools and surrounding grounds. The top floor terrace restaurant also allowed for more of the One World Trade Center to be in the frame of the photos I took. The staff was very friendly, never too busy to deal with whatever I needed at that moment--even if just to chat a bit about my daily adventures! Wait staff at the restaurant also very good--and remembered my usual requests (hot water only for my tea, etc.) as soon as I stepped in for a bite. The food was very good, usually served buffet-style, which I like, and for a set price. My breakfasts usually were substantial enough to get me through a full day of sight-seeing before I needed another meal, so is a very good deal at this hotel. Only reason I gave the World Center Hotel 4 stars instead of five is that there is still construction going on adjacent to it (as there is in so much of New York City, I was to find out :) ...BUT when done, this hotel will be incomparable insofar as its quality and location, location, location! Nearest subway stop at present is about a five-minute walk, but will be just across the street once the construction in this area is finished. So I could not have been more pleased with my stay at the World Center Hotel and grateful that navigating to the rest of the city was so very easy from its location...and enjoyed some really great restaurants in this area as well! BTW--if you get tired of the view at the top-floor World Center Hotel restaurant (I sure didn't) check out Morton's on the hotel's ground floor...fabulous!!!

VI stay in NYC a couple of weekends each month, and I have stayed in many different places. Now when I come into NYC I stay at the Morningside Inn exclusively. Comfortable, affordable and adorable, the Inn is located on the gorgeous Upper West Side next to a beautiful Cathedral. The staff, which allows 24 hour check-in, is so friendly and helpful. The owner/operator Patrick has been extremely helpful and accommodating when it comes to booking my stay, but I have also had no trouble booking online.\u000aThe price can't be beat. They have an accommodation for any traveler's budget.\u000aI really recommend this great little Inn.

Decor was modern and clean. Staff pretty helpful when needed. Didn't use the bar/restaurant but it looked cool and was always busy. Only let down was windows let in a lot of cold air which made the room cold. Would come and stay again! Just make sure they boxed up the window.

VOn 35th Street you are close to Times Square, Empire State and Metro lions to take you where ever you wish. Great for Bryant Park to mingle with the locals behind the library. The room is small but clean and all functional. The air conditioning is a little loud but so is New York! Housekeeping is good and there is a cooler in the room as well as a safe. The rooftop bar has exceptional views and was open from 5.30pm when we were there with a happy hour till 7pm. Only down side for us was the breakfast buffet. It is a little cramped, a little like a cattle market but I suppose that is taste. Not my cup of tea but part of the hotel is the Metro grill in the morning and for a small price you will have a far nicer start to the day with fluffy pancakes, eggs galore and great coffee. Would I stay again..yep definitely as you are central to explore everything.

VI really wanted to love this hotel. It is across the street from the office that I came here to visit on my business trip and in a great part of town. The reviews from past travelers sounded wonderful. And the hotel itself is very nice...extremely clean, very decent sized rooms that are tastefully decorated. Good sized bathrooms with marble counters. Plus the complimentary internet and breakfast is a great perk. Unfortunately, my problem with the hotel has very little to do with the hotel itself but with the level of noise from the busy streets it is located on. The first night I stayed here I got in very late after a grueling day of dealing with flight delays, etc. All I wanted to do was to rest in my room. Within a very short time of getting to my room, I heard a very loud slamming/cranking sound from the street. I called the front desk and asked what the sound was and was told it was the trash pickup and it would stop in a few minutes. About 30 minutes later (after midnite) I called down again because the noise was still going. I asked to be moved to a higher floor (I was on the 7th), but the hotel was sold out that night. The noise finally did stop, but the street noise from below was still pretty loud. The next day, the hotel staff agreed to move me to a room on the 5th floor facing Park Ave instead of 26th, since the trash pickup is on 26th. They were very nice about this and accomodating, which I really appreciated. Unfortuately, the move did not help much with the street noise. I am not sure if being on a higher floor would have helped (the hotel only goes up to the 12th floor). By the third night I finally found a way to drown out the street noise - I turned on the A/C in the room which makes a pretty loud humming noise and turned my iPod on to some soothing music (all rooms have iHome docks for your iPod). This definitely helped and I finally got a good nights sleep. So, bottom line - great hotel if you don't mind either hearing street noise or are OK with a cold room and humming sound from your A/C!!

VStayed at Hotel Giraffe for 3 nights in a double deluxe room with balcony. Room was tastefully furnished and rate included continental breakfast of fresh pastries, diy toast, cereals, fruits and hot and cold beverages. Located in Flatiron district, close to Eataly, an amazing italian gourmet foods deli/cafe/restaurant. Also walking distance to Macy's (10 mins).\u000aWhat I really liked was that the room was quiet as we stayed in Times Square for a week prior and got woken up every night there because of noise from the street.\u000aRoom size - comfortable for our family of 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 younger children. Might be a bit "crowded" if 4 adults sharing.\u000aPros - quiet location, friendly staff and proximity to subway, restaurants and shopping.\u000aCons- breakfast area was always crowded and tables at a premium, no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but you could go down and help yourself to coffee and tea anytime from guest lounge.\u000aSum-up\u000aHotel is lovely for people who don't mind catching subway to Broadway shows, uptown or Soho and Chinatown areas. Area also felt really safe and clean, as basically a business district with offices surrounding it. Walking distance to Union Square Green market - small outdoor market selling lovely fresh fruit, vegies, meat and a great barista.

VWe booked a 5 day leisure trip to NYC and found the Kitano through web search. Price for this boutique little hotel in an underpopulated, very upscale and quiet neighborhood in Murray Hill was excellent when we searched. Two years ago, you could not have touched this room for $450, we paid under $200. This is a very clean hotel and the atmosphere was cordial, but a little stiff. We had ZERO problems or issues with service, no bogus charges, elevators were fast and service was always timely and polite. Rooms were moderate, but bath was large with excellent shower and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries a big plus. Windows were essentially soundproof and opened at the top if you want to prove it to yourself. Location of this place is amazing, in easy walking distance to Les Halles, Little India, Empire State Bldg, Grand Central, Macys and Time's Square. I have done a lot worse in the Big Apple and if the price is this right again, I will return. Arrigato, Kitano.

The Breakfast was a pleasant surprise, lots of lovely fresh bread and rolls, fruit, cereals and more, also tea & coffee was served which was also available all day. After a long day sightseeing, we arrived back at the Hotel to a restful lounge where we were served a cold glass of wine with lots of lovely nibbles, cheese, biscuits, nuts, etc. If you didn't want wine you could choose cold soft drinks, tea or coffee. We took our drink and nibbles up to the roof terrace which was something very special. A very calm and restful Hotel.\u000aAll in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wished we were staying for longer.\u000aWill definately be returning.

VI know it's strange to start out a hotel review with the room service BUT it was that good!!! We do room service a lot (2 little kids) and we all agreed the Italian food was the best ever in the U.S. Especially their raviolis. This is a lovely boutique hotel with a great location and good service. The suite and connecting room we stayed in were spacious if a little cramped on the door swing space. The bathrooms are large . One had a huge 2 or 4 person walk in shower. Seriously that big. And the other had a separated walk in shower, tub and toilet. Very nicely done. Beautiful high count sheets and loads of free snacks. Only downsides: limited table space, super dark rooms and hallways and noisy on a Weekend nights. Lots of loud drunk girls singing JT songs ( badly) and slamming doors at 11 pm and 300 am.\u000aI think we stayed three nights. Definitely recommended! P.s. It's not really kid friendly but the staff were nice and my kids loved it.

Yes, they are on the smaller side, but you aren't here to stay in a resort setting and spend time in your room. Some nice bonuses are the outdoor seating in front of the hotel for the bar and the Whole Foods market right around the corner. Would definately stay here again if I were passing throught NYC and needed a place to stay for a night or two. I belive the paid rates were not bad either for NY.

VI have stayed here on many occasions - approaching 100 room nights in total over the past few years. While there are many shortcomings, it was balanced off by the location and sunny rooms on the upper floors. The lack of quality service was often countered by the reservations manager who helped smooth things over. During this trip he was not available (before or during), while the resulting service was so poor it bordered on offensive. In my attempt to have a polite conversation with the on-duty manager (Matt), his suggestion was that I should not return to the hotel. Stunning... I guess business must be good.

VI had read the reviews about this hotel and was curious to see how it really was. I was travelling with my 11 year old son so wanted an ensuite room. This hotel seemed to offer the best deal, especially with breakfast included. The room was absolutely fine - a double and single bed, tv, wardrobe with hangers, chest of drawers, air conditioning and very clean bathroom with good shower. It was a bit of climb (we were on the 4th floor) but nothing to complain about. Every morning we went to the local bagel shop to have our cream cheese bagels and watch the local residents going to work and school. It was great to be in a neighbourhood, away from the tourist centre (I would avoid anywhere around 42nd St like the plague!). The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful - there was no problem about leaving our bags there on our check-out day. We hired a car for the day and the hire car centre turned out to be in the next street to the hotel! There were 2 street fairs in the neighbourhood while we were there - streets were closed and stalls set up - great for strolling, eating and buying all sorts. One block from the hotel is a regular Sunday market held in a school playground - some great stalls - well worth a visit. Central Park was 2 blocks away and the choice of restaurants is endlesss, as well as super-markets for when you want to save a bit of money. I would most definitely go back to stay here - it suited our needs perfectly and I can't say enough how great an area it is. One slight word of caution - I did see one room opposite ours which was very small with just a double bed, not much space and an internal window (we had 2 windows with views over the street) - it may be worth enquiring about rooms before finalising your booking. But I would highly recommend this hotel if you are happy with a comfy bed, clean room, good location and value for money!

The room itself was the smallest type they offer, and though it was small I had everything I needed and room to move around. Cleverly designed, comfortable, clean, and secure. I was on the third floor, so there was a bit more noise from the street than I am normally accustomed to, but I suppose that's to be expected on a lower floor of a hotel anywhere in NYC. Though I noticed road noise, it did not bother me to the point where it woke me up or served as a distraction. I'd stay here again, and I'd recommend it.

My newspaper of choice, (the times) was delivered every morning before I'd ever dream of waking up therefore it was there for me to enjoy with my coffee. I am already looking forward to staying at the Knick for my next stay in NY.

VMy family just returned from a 4 night stay at the Warwick. We booked this hotel based on family recommendations. I did ask for an outside room in an upper floor but unfortunately got the 4th floor, our room faced the Museum of Modern Art which was fine. There was very little street noise and still offered some view of the street. The Hilton is directly across the street and is very busy which can help when looking for a cab because there are so many parked there at all times. The check in process was very easy, they did not offer to take our bags to the room but I didn't really need them to. We did get free Wifi because we were in a suite but the service seemed to cut in and out. Our room had a very large living room with a table and chairs, large sofa and two chairs. The sofa is a pull-out which would be nice if you needed extra space. The bedroom had two doubles and plenty of space although the bathroom is a little small for being a suite. We did not eat at the hotel but it does have a nice bar and restaurant to eat at, the prices seemed a little high for breakfast but there is a Starbucks across the street and an Au Bon Pain nearby which we frequented for coffee and breakfast. We walked to Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza very quickly, the location is hard to beat unless you want the noise of staying in Times Square. We did eat a late dinner at the Irish Pub just a few doors down and it was just fine and there are pizza places on the next block for a quick lunch too. If I had any complaint it might be that the staff didn't go out of there way to greet us on our coming and goings but that may just be New York. The room was nice, beds comfortable and maid service did a nice job every day. We had a great time in New York and would stay here again.

Very high standard of cleanliness and extremely comfortable beds.\u000aThe door staff are excellent as were the front desk however what really made a big difference to our visit were the excellent concierge team.

VWe visited NY to see U2 in concert and sightsee the city. Staying at The Knick was definitely a great choice! The hotel itself was beautiful and the location could not be better. All the personnel were beyond friendly and helpful from housekeeping to those at the restaurant, concierge and front desk. Truly a super nice experience. We were upgraded to the 11th floor and a front view room - that was so very cool as we had an awesome view of Times Square.\u000aThe only bummer was that since we had my 14 year old we could not visit the roof top bar after 9:00pm. We saved this special visit for our last night in NY and it turned out it was closed that night. Not the hotels fault but really the only disappointing thing that happen during our stay. The elevator at times was at high demand but not an issue at all. The room was super comfortable from remote controls for lights and window blinds. The decor was also modern and uncluttered which was very nice. The room and bathroom were both very comfortable and clean. Even the pillows were super comfy! We had breakfast at the restaurant on our last day and that was also outstanding. The food and service was great.

The staff were super friendly and efficient. Big thank you to Carmen who went out of her way to accommodate me when my mom showed up as a surprise and then upgraded us to a bigger room. The rooms are small, but lovely, clean and the housekeeping staff will bring you anything you need. And who stays in their room in NYC anyway?? Go out and enjoy! The location is perfect for everything and only a couple of blocks from GrandCentral and/or Penn Station if your travels need to take you out of the city. Hotel Soleil NYC has a great bar/restaurant and even a coffee shop attached for that morning fix. Its perfect and I would totally stay here again!!

Of course it\u2019s loud so this should not be a surprise and hotels should be built to manage this\u2026BUT This hotel seriously needs secondary glazing! So noisy without. Placed on fifth floor and moved to 9th as no chance of sleep especially with a 5am 1am 2am (you get the idea) bin truck \u2013 BUT still hard to sleep successfully\u000aAlso VERY loud aircon that only had one setting in our room, there were two actual cool settings, but both did the same = gale @ full freeze\u000aShame because otherwise great, but ended up coming home tired and you can\u2019t do New York tired :O(\u000aSeriously - you have a hotel room to sleep in, and slip should be an easy priority.

VThe location is in a quiet neighborhood on the east side. The rooms are quite spacious and well appointed. Room service is available from third party outside vendors but there is an in house gym that is clean and well maintained. Service ranges from good to poor ...though the staff overall is friendly training seems to be inconsistent. Housekeeping was overly anxious to enter the room prior to check out which caused a disruption and at one point during the stay did not come back when they said they would so the room was not cleaned. The front desk staff gave different answers on how the booking would be handled and when we were checking out and said we needed a cab for ourselves and our luggage we were told to walk down the street to go get one. (At the time there was nobody else at the counter or in the lobby.)

It is walking distance to Rockefeller Square, Radio City, St. Patrics Catherdral and also to Time Square. We had a fabulouse time in NYC and staying at the Warwick NYC contributed to it.

VWe stayed in the Hotel Chandler for a 5 day break for my 30th birthday, unfortunately we arrived on the day of the worst snow fall the city had experienced in years. Despite the weather the doormen were always on hand to help, with bags, taxis, info, ect.\u000aThe room was very clean and was cleaned every day we were there with a turn down service in the evening. The hotel staff were very helpful and would go out of their way to assist in any way they could. We were really let down by the 'super shuttle' service which takes you to and from the airport (would not recommend!) - apparently due to the snow - which was almost gone! but the hotel did everything they could to help us make our flight.\u000aThe hotel bar has 'happy hour' 4pm - 10pm! which is well worth it and the food was nice too.\u000aThe only let downs for us were that there was no tea and coffee facilities in the room (much needed in snowy weather) but there was always a free supply in the foyer. The mini bar/fridge was situated in a cupbaord next to the bed and it was noisy and as per a previous comment I've seen the shower was impossible to turn on without getting covered in cold water! Nice power shower but not very well thought out!\u000aThe location is great, right around the corner from the empire state building and I would definitely recommend the hotel to a freind.

VWe stayed 3 nights for a long weekend--our first trip to NYC. I researched MANY hotels and decided on The Warwick based on reviews from this site, price and location. I was not disappointed. I got a great rate by booking/paying a couple months in advance directly from their website, with daily breakfast buffet included. I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice. The hotel was nice and quiet (we did not have a room with a view, but that was ok). The location, though, is what will definitely bring me back again. Only a few blocks from Central Park, one block from 5th Avenue shopping and within walking distance of Times Square (souvenir heaven and home of Greyline double decker bus tours). After seeing a Broadway show the traffic was gridlocked (no point getting a taxi) and it was an easy walk back to the hotel. Even at night we felt perfectly safe in that location. I would highly recommend the hotel.

VOur two night stay was lovely. The room was (mostly) clean and, for a NYC hotel, fairly large. Before we went to bed the first night I noted the duvet cover was soiled. It actually was a little less than pleasant, but it was too late for me to bother with it. I notified the front desk in the am and it was changed the next day.The bathroom was perfect with a rain head shower. Our biggest complaint was there is a charge for everything, including water bottles. I really do not like to be nickled and dimed. WiFI is free only if you are a hotel club member. We are members, but again, nickle and dimed. Hell's Kitchen, which has been gentrified, is right around the corner, so there is no reason to deal with Times Square restaurants, which is a great bonus. Location, location.

VI booked with points for 2 nights about 2 months ahead. I requested an upgrade and early check-in as a SPG Gold member. When I came at 12:00, no rooms were available. Came back at 2:49 they said I had come too early and I would have to wait for a room. I waited and specifically asked for a room away from the elevators as I had requested on my reservation. They gave me a room right next to the elevators saying that was the only room available. I came back down to the desk and they gave me another room this time around the corner. The room was really old and smelled musty. It faced inside and I was kept awake all night by the noise from the building next to it and the noise from the elevators. I must say I was really disappointed with the hotel. They kept saying because the hotel is so small they had no choice. I had stayed in this hotel a couple of times before and I was on a preferred guest floor and had a pleasant stay due to my membership. I cannot say this time I had a good experience. What is the point of being a SPG member when there are no advantages? I don't think I will stay here again. This experience really turned me away.

VI travel a lot. I stayed at Giraffe 2 weeks and enjoyed every moment of it. One of the best hotels I have stayed in NYC. Great location, wonderful facility (quality is impressive) and fantastic staff (can-do attitude and extremely helpful). Will certainly come back again. I would like to thank the hotel management sincerely for their efforts and care.

VI stayed at the Warwick Hotel Oct 2-6, 2012. The hotel is immaculate and very elegant. I had booked a deluxe room with two double beds along with the full American breakfast. The room was very clean and spacious. The room was on the 6th floor and overlooked 6th Ave. At times the traffic was a bit loud so if you are a light sleeper you might want to request a higher floor. The only other small issue with the room was the lack of free internet. Internet started at $9.95 per hour. The business center offered 15 mins of complimentary use of the internet\u2014to check on your flight, print out boarding passes, etc. After 15 mins there is a charge\u000aThe breakfast buffet was wonderful. The selection included croissants, cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs, French toast, fresh fruit, bagels, smoked salmon, etc. I highly recommend obtaining the full American Breakfast because it is a lovely selection of food and it filled me up for the day.\u000aRandolph\u2019s Bar was a nice place to have a drink after a long day of sightseeing and to grab a small snack too.\u000aEveryone from the doorman to the maid who wanted to do a turn down of the bed were very friendly and extremely helpful.\u000aThe hotel is decorated with old photos of Hollywood movie stars from the 1920s-1930s which adds to the beauty and charm of the hotel.\u000aThe hotel is in a good location too. About two blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. Broadway is also within walking distance. The subway is a short walk from the hotel too. Of course the doorman is always on duty to hail a cab for you too.\u000aYes it is a bit pricey, but then again it is New York City. Would I stay here again yes!

VTook the family (Dad, Mom, two boys, 10 and 7) to the City for a short, one-night stay for dinner and a show, and to see the Natural History Museum and the Historical Society. NYLO Hotel is very conveniently located to see the Museum and the Society (great Superhero exhibit at the Society, btw). Hotel has a great, friendly, helpful staff (shout out to Robert who was great with the kids and helped us get our valet-parked car quickly).\u000aThe room we had was spacious, which was a great surprise for an NYC hotel. Two comfy queen beds and a separate area for watching TV. The bathroom was also very large - especially against NYC-hotel expectations. Nice walk-in shower, not a tub. Well done, NYLO! We did not have much of a view, but the room made up for it.\u000aThe hotel has a cool vibe to it, the bar area has a garage door that can be opened to the street, and there is a room off the lobby that has nice loungers and TVs. Great place to watch football, or have a private party.\u000aWe really enjoyed our stay at NYLO and highly recommend it.

VWe decided to do a last minute NYC weekend and this was a great find! The price was very reasonable for 2 queen tempurpedic beds (low $200s with AAA discount) and the location was so convenient to everything. We walked there from Penn Station and we took the subway everywhere -- didn't need to hail a cab at all. The front office staff was especially helpful when I saw that they offered a AAA discount (which I didn't see when I booked the room on their website) and they honored the discount at check in for me. The complimentary breakfast was more than adequate to get us going in the morning (bagels, donuts, waffles, pancakes, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, milk, tea & juice). Room was fine sized with an in-room safe. We definitely would stay here again on a future NYC trip.

VWe'd stayed at the hotel four times when it was known as On The Avenue, and enjoyed it then, but found our recent five-night experience under the new NYLO ownership to be superior in every way. The hotel is vibrantly contemporary, and the rooms quite large for a NYC hotel (particularly the bathroom), tastefully furnished and scrupulously maintained. Everyone from the doorman to the bellman, the front desk staff, and the wait staff at Serafina's were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. And the continental breakfast included in our room rate, and served in the comfortable, attractive Serafina's, was more than generous. As an ex-New Yorker, I love staying on the Upper West Side because it's a true and relaxed neighborhood rather than a warren of hotels. So much is within walking distance--Central Park to the East, Riverside Park to the West, The Museum of Natural History, a wealth of restaurants and stores--and what isn't, such as the theatres, is simply a short taxi or subway ride away. NYLO, with its up-to-date ambience that serves to make one comfortable rather than intimidated, is a perfect fit for the neighborhood--and for us. We've already recommended the hotel to several friends, and will definitely stay there whenever we're in NYC.

VThis hotel has good views, at least if you get the highest floors faccing the uptown, if not book another hotel. The room is ok, new furniture and a comfy bed but the floor has a carpet and the door against the hallway has a 2 cm opening under the door. If you lay down you could see what happens in the area outside the room. There may also be BEDBUGS there as many other hotels on Manhattan. Thats a NO NO for me, and im never comeing back here. Its loud, you can hear other people in other rooms when they are talking. On the plusside they have a bar, beer house near the reception. No breakfast.

The only thing I wasn't a super fan about was the limited room service menu. I was hoping for more American/comfort food being that it was a Hyatt but they use their restaurant (Fourth)'s kitchen. Extremely limited items. Not a ton of choices within walking distance if you are traveling solo. I tried the Mexican restaurant across the street - gross! Overall I would return here and probably try the sushi place across the street.

The staff were all young, friendly and helpful and it was wonderful to come down of a morning and smell the coffee brewing and grab a cup out in the courtyard before heading out for the day.\u000aLoved the location, the decoration and the coffee.

VWe have stayed twice. If you have reason to be on the Upper West Side, this is the place to stay. The deluxe king double is a large room with windows on three sides, far roomier than the queen. The rooms are immaculate and highly functional. The public space on the ground floor is a great place to meet friends for a drink or game of chess. Staff members are friendly and helpful. And they allow dogs!\u000aTwo complaints: The reception desk gets backed up due to a lack of personnel and there is the inflated "Urban resort fee". It is pricey and practically worthless. As a superior property NYLO should refuse to assess this daily charge. It gouges their customers.

VI stayed last Friday evening for a belated birthday. I received a bottle of sparkling wine in the room and I was upgraded to the 17th floor. I had a gorgeous city view with high ceilings and full windows. I also got a chance to "spin the wheel" at the front desk as a Kimpton In Touch member and won another $15 in Raid the Minibar credits!!This was my 1st time at Ink 48 but I have stayed at the other Kimpton properties in NY (The Muse, Park 70, and Eventi). Ink 48 is a far west as you can get so the location is a bit out of the way but fine if you don't mind walking a few blocks to the subway. I prefer it though to the congested, touristy Times Square area.\u000aWe had an issue with the safe upon arrival but two extremely nice gentlemen from security were up within 5 minutes and fixed it. We also encountered numerous helpful employees at check in and in passing in the hallways. As a tip- I parked at a garage near the Skyline Motel for only $38 for 24 hours. This was 1-2 blocks away versus the $55 to valet.\u000aMy only minor complaint was the 5-6pm happy hour which was served in a dark corner of the lobby and no food was provided. At the Eventi last year it was wonderful with an assortment of fresh fruit, cheeses, etc to accompany the wine. However, we turned a negative into a positive and had great margaritas at the Print restaurant bar.\u000aI definitely would stay again!

VMy friends and I (6 of us) were mainly in NYC for a concert at Madison Square Garden, so this location was absolutely perfect for our 5 night stay. We chose the Affinia properties because of the \u201capartment\u201d rooms with a kitchenette. We were uncertain about the Manhattan versus the Shelburne, as the Shelburne had much better reviews on TA, but we stuck with the Affinia Manhattan because of the better location, and we were so happy with our stay! Despite the 3pm check-in time, our room wasn\u2019t ready for another few hours, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal as there is so much to explore around the hotel (Macy\u2019s/Herald Square is a few blocks down, cafe\u2019s/restaurants/shops are all along 7th Ave, and Times Square is only a 15 minute walk away). Jonathan at the front desk was very sincere about this inconvenience and compensated us with drinks at their bar.\u000aWe booked the room with 2 dbl beds, a pull-out sofa couch, kitchenette and 2 bathrooms, which we found was surprisingly spacious for NYC, but both bathrooms were quite small. You can tell the rooms are a bit dated, but most importantly we found it quite clean. And even though we were on the 20th floor, the street noise (mainly sirens) was quite loud every night \u2013 but again we deliberately booked in a busy area of NYC!

VI know this is considered a cheap price for Manhattan, and the location was very convenient.\u000a\u000aDue to a mid-week trip elsewhere I stayed in two different rooms.\u000aThe first room I stayed in was ok though shabby looking (worn carpets and curtains. not very appealing).\u000aThe second room I stayed in was horrible - hairs all over the bathroom, wooden board lining the sink stuck with gaffer tape.\u000aHowever, the main horror was BEDBUGS. I was bitten all over my body, and am still recovering (after three weeks!). I told the receptionist about this and he said that they would check the room and refund me if there were bedbugs in the room. I never heard back from the hotel, even after sending several emails, with photos showing the pattern of the bites that is typical of bedbugs ('three in a row' straight lines).\u000aJust so you know:\u000aBedbugs are really difficult to get rid of once they've settled in your house - you can actually bring them home with you if they've decided to move into your suitcase. So if you encounter such a problem here (or any hotel) MOVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT IN YOUR SUITCASE.

VGreat old-style NYC hotel that has the perfect Christmas vibe. Beautifully lit and decorated, it makes you feel like you step back in time. Until you enter the lobby. NYC during the Christmas season is very busy and obviously crowded, but for such an elegant external appearance, the lobby/reception area was very crowded and a bit disorganized. That being said, our room was very large, especially for an NYC hotel. We had a view of 6th Avenue. Very comfortable bed, sitting area and large closet area. We were in NYC for only a night, yet had a very pleasant experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants easy access to midtown and other NYC attractions.

My room was very comfortable (overlooked the courtyard, not 10th Ave). The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I had a chance to speak with Alvin and Mia - both commendable hosts. I forgot my mac power adapter (so annoying) and they found it for me and held it for 10 days. Mia even remembered our conversation a week after I reported it missing. Having the High Line at your doorstep is amazing, if you are into that kind of thing (which I am). The hotel is a converted convent and the hotel has 66 rooms but not much else. No restaurant but an amazing one across the street. No gym but you get access to Equinox three blocks away! Overall I think this hotel was a great value.

VI spent 3 nights at Ink48 over memorial Day weekend. It's definitely off the beaten path away from all the touristy areas, but still near everything.\u000aThe entire staff was professional, friendly and accommodating. I asked for early check-in and once my room was ready, they seeked me out in the den area. Check- in and check-out was quick and uncomplicated.\u000aI had a corner city-view room. It was very large compared to other NYC hotels that i have stayed at. And it was impeccably clean.\u000aThe food at the Print restaurant was amazing, as was the service. The roof top lounge, The Press, offers breath taking city views in a living room type atmosphere.\u000aI definitely plan on staying here on future trips to NYC.

Vin our visit to USA (2 parents + 2 adult children) we stayed in 4 & 5 stars hotels. this was the least successful. the hotel is very clean, very central, many beautiful pictures (that did make my experience better- helpful), but the service was poor.\u000ain comparison to other hotel, this hotel is "petty". standard breakfast costs 33$ compared to 16$ (4-5 stars : Hilton , Boston or Washington). this was the only hotel that charged for Wi Fi 10 $ with extra 3 $ for more than 2 devices. I did not succeed to connect to the internet during the day, but only early in the morning when the net was not busy. when I asked for aid they said that the problem was with my cell phone (non professional).\u000aIn every other hotel we stayed there was a coffee machine. here there was not. may be they forgot. then i will expect the room service to notice that.\u000aIf you need a refrigerator it costs extra 20 $. In other hotels, it is free and included.\u000athe employees are nice, but those in the front doors are not concentrated in comparison to other luxurious hotel we visited.\u000afor less price we got more spacious and more equipped suites in other main cities in the USA. the 4 stars hotel in Washington Dc was better in many grades. it was not what I expected in Manhattan.\u000athe air condition what set in a fixed flow that disturbed listening to the TV. there is no option to decrease the flow.\u000aAgain, I did my review with comparison to other hotel standards in the USA.

VI have stayed at the Paramount four times over the last few years and have generally been thrilled with the location and happy with the rooms (although have had to be upgraded a couple of times due to the small sizes). Have always looked forward to the buffet breakfasts and the service provided by the staff, especially Luis, Alam and Chevarlo (my "breakfast boys"), who always greet me with hugs when I arrive; just the thing to make a lone traveller feel at home. The Breakfast Package used to be $15 plus tips and taxes but just before I arrived it almost doubled to $28. If you don't get the online breakfast package then expect to pay $43 for breakfast with tips and taxes! You can get a great Prix Fix dinner for that at Broadway Joe's in Restaurant Row over 8th Ave for the same price. Around the corner at Pigalle you can get a buffet breakfast for $23 including tips and taxes. Because I generally stay for 2-3 weeks I have been given complmentary wifi in my room which is just great - no running down to the lobby to check email in the middle of the night. Service generally has improved (except for the price of breakfast) but I really missed the smiles and cheery conversations with my "breakfast boys". There is a supermarket on 49th and 8th where food for a cheap breakfast can be purchased the night before. Or there are a lot of delis on 8th and 9th Aves or even Junior's for breakfast. The Paramount is never going to be a 5 star hotel so please don't charge 6 star prices for a breakfast.

VWe had a top floor corner room and the views and space were a great asset to a few days in NY. Bed was very comfortable and being so high up the busy noise of NY is not a problem. Hotel is very new and is close to Times Square which makes it handy for theatres and transport and many of the tourist attractions of NY. We didn't eat in the hotel as only a few minutes away on 46th St there were a range of good restaurants to choose from - including Italian, Spanish, an Irish pub and US style grills (and I think Japanese). We did use the hotel lounge for a few post dinner drinks and the service was good and prices OK for a good hotel in NY.

VI'm usually a very fair reviewer.\u000aI booked a deluxe one-bedroom suite with private terrace for one night, 6 weeks before date of stay. The purpose of the visit was to show my 13 yr old grandson the "big city", his first time. I booked over the phone, and booked this particular suite because of the terrace and the views that were described on the website and because of the photos of the views from the terrace.\u000aI specifically told the reservationist what I was looking for - separate sleeping areas, and a view.\u000aI called again a few weeks later to reiterate the desire for separate sleeping areas and a view. I was told not to worry, I would get just that.\u000aThe morning of the stay, I called again to let them know the time of our arrival, about 1pm.\u000aWe arrived at 2pm due to traffic, and walked up to the desk to be told "There is a problem with your booking, we don't have a suite with a terrace available." How do you not have the room I booked if I booked it six weeks ago, and just this morning was told everything was all set?\u000a"Well, I guess our system messed up." Well, then I want a different room with a terrace and a view, and separate sleeping areas.\u000aAfter going back and forth and telling the desk clerk that it was unacceptable to be told just THAT morning that my room was set, the manager came out and told me "Well, sometimes people get the wrong idea that they'll get the room they want based on pictures on the internet." Well, YES, especially if you include descriptions that say "One Bedroom Terrace Suite features one queen bed, two baths and views of the Manhattan skyline, Hudson River and Freedom Tower."\u000aAfter my insistence that we get the room I booked or better, I was given the key to a room - walking into the tiny dark space, there was one bed, no sofabed (not an option for a grandmother to share a bed with a 13yr old boy, who had been standing with me at the desk), a terrace that was not accessible as the lock was broken, and it wouldn't have mattered anyway because the "view" was from the 2nd floor, of an alleyway. To top it off, the toilet was broken.\u000aI went back to refuse the room, and was told "well, you insisted on the terrace." After more back and forth, I was given a one bedroom suite, with no terrace and no views. This whole process took over an hour and a half.\u000aOn the way out for what was remaining of the afternoon, I asked that the sofabed be made up. On returning, it was not. The next request got us our pillows from the "pillow menu", which really don't help if you're sleeping on a sofa with no sheets. It took a 3rd request for the sofabed to be made up.\u000aThe room itself was spacious enough, the bathrooms tiny, but in general everything was dinged and dirty. There was an ancient old window-type ac in the bedroom, that screeched so loudly I had to shut it off and sleep in the heat.\u000aA shower in the morning revealed that there was no shampoo in the dispenser, it had been filled with conditioner.\u000aAs far as location - it depends on what you need. If you are mostly exploring Times Square, Central Park, etc, then you are better off closer to there as it's a good 15-20 minute walk with not much in between. It's convenient to Macy's, the ESB.\u000aIn fairness, I was compensated for the downgrade in room by an amount that slightly exceeded the difference in value. However, that does not change the fact that the whole purpose of booking this particular hotel was for the terrace and city view which we did not get, nor did I get a good night's sleep due to the ac. It seemed obvious to me that because we were staying for a single night and had not been past customers, we were simply bumped out of the room I booked when they needed to fit other bookings in. There is no way it was a "booking error" if I had been confirmed 3 different times. I wrote an email to management to explain my displeasure a few days after our visit in April, but have not heard a word back.\u000aBe aware if this is a one-night stay that they do not value your booking.

VI was there on 30Dec14. It was a 3day business trip.\u000aHotel rooms\u000aThe rooms are small & cramp. I had to shift some furniture to make space to place my cargo bag.\u000athe toilet is a disappointment, unique wash basin, a metal stand alone wash basin, which doesnt not leave much space to put my toiletries. I had a stand up shower space which is ok, but the water pressure was weak.\u000aNo coffee maker / water kettle provided. View was facing another building wall.\u000aStaff\u000aThe hotel staff are average new yorker standard. if they are happy on that day, they will help you , if its the other way around, then they will give you a cold shoulder.\u000aLobby\u000aThe lobby is unique. It is a space where a DJ will spin from 7pm onwards , where one can sit and chill at the lobby. Because of this concept, the lobby is dark. Please be extra careful when you are checking in/out of the hotel of your belongings.\u000aGYm.\u000aGym is bad. Small room.\u000aLocation\u000athe location is the one thing they are good for. 1 min walk to towards your left , you have reach times square. where all the shopping, photography experience will be at .\u000aOther than that , there is nothing much to say about this hotel. Nothing outstanding & interesting. Nothing that bad to say.\u000aIf you are always out & about in NYC, then its ok to get this hotel. But If comfort is also important , then this is not a hotel for you.\u000aI didnt take any photo as i was too busy.

VAn absolute gem of a hotel in New York City. The staff made us feel very welcome at this small hotel and we received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and were welcomed to our room with a chilled bottle of prosecco and two huge cupcakes. Room was very spacious and very comfortable and very clean. Even although it was cold outside the room was always nice and cosy. Turn down service at nights along with chocolates was a very nice touch which was a nice welcome after a long day going about NYC. Breakfast in the mornings was excellent and the waiting staff were very polite and friendly. We experienced the cheese and wine on only one occasion and it went down a treat. The concierge was first class, I asked them to book a table at a restaurant that had been recommended to us by friends and they didn't give up until they had a confirmed booking. Thay also kept you right as regards directions and which underground train to use to get us where we wanted to go.\u000aEvery member of staff was polite and always ready to help.\u000aAs far as we are concerned this is the only hotel to stay in NewYork, when we return to NYC this will be the only hotel on our agenda to stay in.\u000aHotel Giraffe is very central to all the attractions which was ideal for us.\u000aA very big thank you to all the staff at Hotel Giraffe for making our stay in NYC memorable.\u000aOur next visit to the Big Apple will hopefully be not too far away.

VThis small, historic hotel is conveniently located near Rockefeller Center and within easy distance of major shopping and entertainment. I\u2019ve stayed here on several occasions. One of the hotel's attractions is the cozy atmosphere and good food at Randolph's Bar and Lounge, which I prefer over their more formal Murals on 54 restaurant. The rooms are a decent size and wonderfully clean. I didn't give the hotel a higher rating because, with the exception of the staff in Randolph's, the staff, in general, is efficient but not friendly. The doormen are usually not overly helpful, and there's one, in particular, who, on every visit, is downright rude. It's difficult to understand why he's still employed there. This hotel could be a complete gem with friendlier staff.

VThe Roxy Hotel is so close to so many restaurants, bars, and tourist locations (Chinatown, World Trade, etc.), and is really close to a subway entrance with a straight shot up to Central Park, etc. The hotel is interesting inside and the vibe is great! The made the best use of space in our room and the decor as fun and definitely not the normal boring hotel decor. The only downside for me, and this is actually not a reflection on the room, but a heads up to women...make sure you ask for a full-size bathroom. Our room was definitely suited to one person traveling, and probably not a woman. Very little counter space in the bathroom, which made it a little difficult to get ready. The bar and restaurant were great, and the coffee shop was delicious - to be honest, I would have liked having a coffee pot in my room, but if I had to go get coffee, theirs was fantastic! There was music every afternoon and evening, people coming and going constantly, a movie place downstairs...just overall good energy. The staff...in a word, fantastic. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, funny, and just plain nice! I am one of those people who values customer service above just about anything, and theirs was topnotch!

VWe stayed as a family at this hotel for a weekend getaway. It is close to main subway lines and Union Square has its own attractions; Farmers Market, Chanting monks in the Union Square, close by delicious City Bakery, Max Brenner, Joe's Coffee, East & West Village, Gramercy, Eataly..they're all at walking distance. Hotel itself was relatively new property but rooms were very small. It was difficulty even to turn in the bathroom. We had a terrace but no view. We asked for child crib, first two of them were broken, was finally fixed on third try. The restaurant and cafe at the hotel is nice for breakfast or dinner; however , being in the middle of Manhattan you have many more options around. I suggest trying Union Square Cafe. If you want to shop at the Farmer's Market, go early, good stuff usually sells out first. Also the pretzel-croissants at the City Bakery tend to finish early too, enjoy them early in the day; don't forget the chocolate croissant, out of this world.

VMost people's definition of a 'getaway' is OUT of the city. But this adorable oasis in TriBeCa makes you feel like you're a hundred miles away from the hustle and bustle. My husband and I just spent the most relaxing 24 hours we've had in years! The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home - They even really seem like they enjoy working there!\u000aWe started with spa treatments at the Shibui Spa. I had a facial and my husband had a massage. I think they made us feel 10 years younger! So wonderful! We also had a 30 minute 'soak' for two which made my skin so soft and us both so relaxed. The staff at the spa was so sweet and the setting is gorgeous - The pool looked inviting but we didn't get to use it - perfect temperature and the room isn't steamy like it is with other hotel pools. The scents throughout the spa and hotel are so inviting.\u000aWe had a delicious lunch in the hotel's restaurant, Locanda Verde, which was amazing and breakfast the following morning there was to die for. You'll have to read my restaurant review for details!\u000aOur room was beautiful (we had a king size bed which I don't think they have many of) and the linens were so so soft and comfortable. The bed is on the firm side for my taste but that's just me trying to find something to pick on. By far, this room had the BEST hotel shower EVER!\u000aGranted, this hotel is a total splurge for us. But they appreciate their customers. Wi-fi is included and so are all these wonderful snacks and waters (usually we get charged stupid money for these things at other hotels).\u000aWe don't get away much--But when we do, we like to do it right. And this hotel does 'right' perfectly. I will be dreaming of going back the The Greenwich Hotel for many nights to come...

VI was struggling to look for a reasonably priced hotel for a group of four girls for my friend's bachelorette party. I really wanted a suite so we could have sitting area to open gifts and enjoy each other's company. Affinia was a great option -- we had the living room area with a sofa bed that comfortably accommodated what we were looking for.\u000aIt wasn't the nicest hotel I have stayed in, but this was a great option for four 20-somethings. The kitchenette was a nice perk too for the drinks and snacks, I just wish the drinking glasses were larger. I know that's a small thing, but important when you have to keep remaking cocktails!\u000aI would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling in a group similar to my situation.

VI stayed here on a business trip after passing up on many other brand-name chains that were actually more expensive on these particular dates. All the research paid off because it was exactly what I wanted: luxurious, clean, quiet, away from the hustle of Broadway, friendly, and, of course, not overpriced. Obviously everything in Manhattan is expensive, but for the money, I rather go for quiet and luxurious than crowded, flashy, and impersonal. The lobby is small, but modern with a bar and seating area. The rooms (and I was in a standard) are very large with two windows, a walk-in closet, separate make-up area, two-chair seating area, desk, and minibar. There are numerous modern lights at desks, seating areas, each bed-side table (both general and flexible reading lamps), the walk-in closet, and hall. It actually took quiet a while to turn everything off. There was a huge flat screen TV on the wall with sufficient channels. All in all, it is a great place to which I will be returning next week and probably weeks to come. If there are any downsides, I'd say the bath room, despite being another very well appointed space, was a bit small. If you need counter space or two sinks, you won't get it here, but you'll love the design, lighting, amenities, and hot water shower heads (yes, two heads). Also, if you like being in a busy neighborhood, this is not your place. If you like being a few blocks away from the crowds and a couple blocks from the subway with plenty of eateries, this is a good place for you.

VStayed first time this thanksgiving. I liked the fact that it is on UWS away from the throngs and the noise of Midtown. Residential area, several eating options over on broadway, amsterdam and columbus. Right on No1 subway with easy access to downtown.Walking distance from central park, Museum and on sundays the school has flea market.\u000aRooms are small, strange configuration of bathroom. The shower part is cheap with plumbing and shower curtains. the sink has flat base and will not drain well. AS other reviews mentioned there is some lack of cleanliness- the bathroom floor had shoe stain that remained there, the door has glass which obviously has not received cleaning for some time. The toiletries are some cheap brand so bring your own and CVS 24 hrs is right across 77th. No housecleaning harassed me and stay was relatively peaceful and quiet.\u000aBTW- the front desk gave me courtesy room wifi which was nice, but when requested late check out she said the best she could do is 1 pm !! And i requested a cab, they offered their own service, stated 55 dollars flat, pay cash, because the driver told me if I am using CC there will be 8 dollar extra, although the front dest failed to tell me that.

VActually I stayed there for three nights in the summer of 2009. I can remeber very good everything: the big hall, the big room, the comfortable beds and the bathroom was right clean and big. I was there with my sister, for the first time in the US and we can reach the most important places very easily. Central park is so near, that you can take a walk to get there. Absolutely adviced!!!

VThis was our first time to NYC & we spent ages on this site looking for an affordable hotel that had good reviews & it seems we struck gold.\u000aThis hotel is a little gem! From the moment we got there to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. The receptionist who checked us in was lovely, I had e-mailed the hotel prior to arriving to ask for a high room & that it was a Birthday celebration for both me & my husband & we had room on the 11th floor (1117) with a box of chocs! The room was facing the front of the street & you could hear some traffic but it wasn't too bad. The room was a good size & decorated exceptionally well. The fridge was handy to store drinks in. We booked a bus tour through them which was handled very well.\u000aBreakfast as most people have said was good - huuuuge muffins!!!\u000aThe rooftop terrace was lovely - the bar wasn't open as we went at the end of April so we just bought a couple of drinks from the coke machine & sat up there taking in the view of the ESB.\u000aWe would definately stay here again & would recommend it to anyone!!\u000a

VI must say this is the first Trip Advisor review I have ever written because I had to share my wonderful experience at the Knickerbocker Hotel. I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel during the soft opening. Everything was top notch; service, food, cleanliness, and etc. They paid attention to every little detail and made sure my stay was superb. I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking to stay at one of the best hotels in the city, definitely coming again!

The room was small with no view but was well appointed. Check in and check out was a breeze with efficient and very friendly staff. There were only two elevators but there was never much of a wait. They offered complimentary coffee in the lobby or on the second floor at all times. We were very pleased during our stay and would definitely stay there again.

V1- the staff there is extremely rude and not interested in helping in the least. plan on lugging all of you luggage up the multiple flights of stairs without even an an attempt to ask if you need help.\u000a2-rooms are super small. i thought this would be ok because i was getting such a great price, but these rooms were closets. you had to walk sideways to get around. oh and our toilet was clogged when we first arrived. not to mention the stained sheets.\u000a3-ridiculous noise pollution. the radiator clicked and clanked, outside traffic seemed like it was happening in the room, and the people next door decided it would be a good idea to have the noisiest "relations" of their lives. that too seemed like it was happening in the same room. gross.\u000a4-i couldn't stand to sleep there another night, and was not able to get my money back for the next 2 nights due to a 48 hr cancellation policy. how i was supposed to know this place was way below the standard of care before i arrived, i'm not sure. but they didn't care. and the so-called manager seemed to NEVER show his face to be talked to. so i was out of the money, but it was worth it to never step foot in that place again.\u000aConclusion: the WORST!

Breakfast (two bowls of granola, one bowl of berries, and coffee) was pricey at $35.00, so we ate at Moonstruck at Madison & 38th, one block away for a third of the price. Beds very comfortable. Convenient location. When taking a bus, we were only 4 short blocks away from a stop to go either E/W or N/S. The beautiful weather added to our wonderful stay.

VSpent a week at the Interconti Times Square before the blizzard hit. Had a room on the 36th floor with a great view. Beds very comfy, well appointed bathroom and a decent HDTV to keep you company. The hotel has a great group of doormen, from Jeffery, Vladimir, Santiago and the rest of the crew who welcome you when you arrive, and assist with calling cabs, advise on NYC and helping you get around. We used the concierge service and found them informative and helpful. The housekeeping staff are also top notch and importantly, the elevators are fast and things just work. Whislt it's not the cheapest in NYC, its certainly not a rip off. We got a great rate from the hotel's website and also checked in for a night just after new year. It's close enough to Times Square, Fifth Avenue, Madison and Central Park is up the road too. Famiglia and John's is a quick walk away... Will certainly visit again!!!

VWe stayed at the Cassa for about 5 days at the start of September and loved it. Firstly I have to mention some of the staff by name - they were brilliant - and really went out of their way to help.\u000aOn arrival I was looking into where to go for a good run and Vilma not only talked me through good route options, she even went and printed out bus timetables to get me to good running spots, whilst I was out getting my bearings. She couldn't do enough to make me feel at home. She was so helpful.\u000aAnd she made some great restaurant recommendations and even offered to phone ahead to make reservations.\u000aAnd Felix - working on the door - was so polite and sorted out a private car for us to get to the airport on our final day.\u000aThe hotel itself is really well located. It's like 5 mins from Times Square. Close enough to get to it but far enough that you're not hearing the hustle and bustle 24/7. There are some great little eateries nearby - not surprising as the hotel is situated right on the border of Hells Kitchen. So there are great local diners for breakfast or the evening meal, if you haven't wandered off too far at that point.\u000aThe rooms are fine. For the price you pay I wasn't expecting the plaza suite. We could have done with a little more storage space - cupboards, drawers, etc as we pretty much lived out the suitcases. But hey, the room was clean and well looked after and was very modern.\u000aAnd when ever we needed ice or anything, the staff were only to eager to help.\u000aA great little hotel in a great location. I wouldn't hesitate to go again.

VIt ws a last minute trip, so it was not that easy to find an affordable hotel. The location is fantastic, walking distance to almost everything, and at night we did not hear any noise. Our room was located in front of the elevator, but we did not hear a thing. it was a quite spacious room with two double beds( we were 3 in the room) and we had a "view" of the construction on 54th street. This room was supposed to be an upgrade to a premium room from deluxe.....\u000aThe hotel is clean and well maintained, a lot of staff. with the staff it's a bit hit and miss, some are great others less so. Our room smelled very bad like mildew coming from the bathroom curtain and our safe did not work. after several visits from 3 security personel and 2 engineers over the whole day, we were told to use the one at reception....\u000aBreakfast was good, but be prepared for the mindblowing high bill. 2 eggs, 4 coffees and an orange juice for 54 dollars!\u000aThere is a starbucks around the corner.\u000aWould I go back? I think so, because besides these problems it is a very good price for the location, will you find better if you have time to plan? I would say so. If in a pickle to find an affordable place, definitely recommendable, if you have more time or a bigger budget I would say pass and go somewhere else.

We were on 5 th floor overlooking the street.\u000aThe problem with the hotel was that everything was too dark with lighting levels more akin to a nightclub than a hotel. it was a constant irritation for loads of us to even find the right button to press in the elevators and iPhones were being used as torches to do so. the Lobby area was equally ill lit and not appealing to us at all.\u000aSecurity was tight with passes having to be shown to get to the elevator area so that was excellent and along with the door staff these security guys and gals were polite and friendly.

VI don't usually write reviews, but I truly enjoyed my trip to NYC this year. I mean, NYC is awesome, and there are tons of hotels but this one really is great. It is near a bunch of train stations so going anywhere is super easy. They apparently just finished renovating so the restaurant wasnt fully open, but dinner there was delish!! The lobby area has a fireplace and lots couches to relax in. It feels like home. The rooms are large and clean. The staff is GREAT; there is something about walking up to the front of the hotel or front desk or even in the hallways and seeing employees laughing and enjoying their time there. I received a note from Amanda, the front office manager, in my room, which was a nice touch. I happen to meet her and she, like many of their staff was laughing and joking around - it made me and my boyfriend feel extremely comfortable so thank you! This hotel is luxury without being stuffy. We will be back

VI was worried about the location of this hotel being too close to the action that we would never get a bit of peace and quiet but that was not true at all with this property. The rooms were very quiet in this hotel, I did not hear the noise from outside at all. It was so easy to get places from this location. Stepping out your door, there are not alot of people so it is an easy walk to the subway terminal at Grand Central station/42nd and from there you can pretty much go anywhere. It is a short 7 blocks to Time Square. I would definitely come back to this property if the price was right again.

Mini bar - empty so basically a mini fridge. No coffee machine but 24 hour coffee downstairs for free - odd! Free breakfast and wine hour (bad white wine but good cheese). Fast wi fi but crappy desk lighting. Really a property of contradictions. I think in summary quirky. You may love it for it has a homesy feel but not for me again I think.

VStayed here in January 2014 and would highly recommend\u000aThe hotels is between 5th and 6th avenue in midtown and is a block away from the Empire state. So great location - Times Square, Rockerfeller, Grand Central Station, NY Public Library etc, are only a few blocks away. The nearest subway, at the end of the road, is Herald Square and that takes you directly to Chinatown/Little Italy. Four blocks away is Penn Station which is where the train from JFK goes (provided it is running, which it wasn't when we were on our way back to the airport grrr panic oh my god howarewemeanttogethome etc.)\u000aThe room was good - water and coke in your room on arrival, good fridge, massive telly, good aircon (very necessary as it was minus 16 outside). Great bathroom with super duper shower. Negative: got electric shocks everytime I touched anything, but that could be me and my magnetic personality. Yeah it's small but it's in the middle of Manhattan so that's a bit of a first world problem imo!\u000aBreakfast is a selection of bagels and some other pastries, yoghurt and apple/orange juice and tea/coffee. Good way to start the day.\u000aFree wi-fi, rooftop bar which would be nice if it weren't arctic temperatures outside. Hotel has a nice art-deco style.\u000aGood Stuff Metro hotel, nice one.

VWe stayed at this hotel for one night (thankfully!) on our trip to NYC this past February. When we arrived, we weren't sure if we were in the right place because there was scaffolding all around the front entry and the lobby was under construction. It would've been nice to have been notified that the hotel is under construction because we probably would've avoided it. I couldn't believe when the staff member told us our room was on the lower level (AKA...the basement!!). I thought...this has to be a joke! We went down one floor to what we ended up referring to as "the dungeon". There are 3 rooms down there, and it is ICE cold! The rooms are teeny, which we didn't really care about, but the window was looking out to the ground level which meant anyone could go back there and look through our window! I happened to look at the fire escape directions...which are completely inaccurate and don't make sense. When I mentioned this to the staff member they said that in order to get to the stairs in case of a fire, we had to go through a door marked "staff only". The only good part of our stay was the location (2 blocks from times square!), and the continental breakfast was really great! If we ever went back, I would have to request a room NOT in the basement!!

The property was well maintained and had a club-like atmosphere about it.\u000aOur room was on the 11th floor, and had good sound-proof windows (evidenced by the noise level when they were open), and very quiet air-conditioning. There was fresh bottled water left in the room each day, and chocolates provided by the evening turn-down service. Both wireless and wired internet were available for free in the room.\u000aThe complementary continental breakfast included pastries, bagels, eggs, fruit salad, juices and yogurt, as well as a variety of specialty coffees. Coffee was also available throughout the day. Evenings included complementary wine and cheese and a piano player.\u000aThe location was very central and right on the 6 subway line. I would definately stay here again. There may be cheaper hotels, but most would charge for breakfast and internet, so these freebies make the Giraffe a really good deal.

VI came to affinia manhattan for four nights in August 2015. The property is absolutely awesome however some of the staff are poor hence the title of the review. During my fours nights I would describe 90% of interactions with staff as poor.\u000aStarting with the check in. My wife had booked and paid for a deluxe room. At check in the lady (Elizabeth) checked us into a lower standard of room on the 6th floor. She didn't look like she wanted to be there on check in and compounded the issue by making such a basic mistake. It's like getting the wrong order from a restaurant. So once we realised we were in the wrong room we then had to carry all our luggage downstairs, queue up again to allow Elizabeth to correct her mistake. However, this was our first impression of affinia manhattan.\u000aThe next issue I had was with the battery in the door running out. The room keys are rely of an electronic mechanism in the door to recognise the room key and the open the door. One afternoon, I returned to my room alone (as my wife was at the apple store). When I inserted my key the light flashed red/green so I went downstairs to enquire. The guy on the front desk then took my room key and asked to see identification and proof of my booking before he would reprogramme the key (as at the point we both thought the room key was the issue). I was surprised that all the identification and proof of booking was necessary, given that I had presented him with the key. His point was that I could have found the key on the floor.... He apologised in the end and sent me on my way with a reprogrammed key.\u000aGuess what? The key didn't work so I then had to head all the way back to reception for them to get security to have a look at the door.\u000aThe final issue I had with the reception is with Carl (the crook) aka Carl the luggage man. So at the end of our stay, we check out (again via Elizabeth). She sends us to Carl who is by the reception desk (near the drinks and snacks). Carl advises us that the room we have been sent to is full but if we follow him across the lobby there is room in the 2nd luggage cupboard. So me and my wife carry our 4 bags across the lobby to where Carl is now standing. Carl then points to a sign and then asks for payment. (in my head I'm asking "payment for what?"). As, its last day, we are running low on dollars, so Carl is quick to tell us where the nearest cash machine is to pay him for God knows what. The sign Carl has up is below... £1 per bag. So anyway, I give him £10 (for doing nothing but hold our bags in a room until our flight). Now here is why Carl is a crook. We had 4 bags - 4 x 1 = £4 (bear in mind that he has not carried our bags and he is merely locking them away). From the £10 that he has extorted I expected £6 change - right? Wrong, Carl counts "1, 2, 3, 4, thank you". This all happened in the lobby of a quality hotel. Now as a tourist, if I'm in harlem at 2am, I could reasonably expect to be robbed. I do not expect to be robbed/extorted in the lobby of a hotel across the road from madison sq gardens.

VI give this five stars because of the great value it is! We stayed here quite randomly and I never expected it to be such an attractive place with good service, etc. The room was lovely and comfortable. We enjoyed the lounge also and it is in a good central location. I stayed at the Hudson before this and would much rather stay here again. I walked all over looking for a great breakfast place and it turned out the best around was in the restaurant here - gourmet, interesting, excellent and not too pricey.

VI arrived at the Warwick early in the day and somewhat fatigued. The amazing front desk personnel took such good care of me. I was escorted to a room that looked and smelled heavenly. When it was time to bath and get into bed, The Warwick didn't disappoint. I had two short days but it required all my will to get out of the luxurious bed. The linens were sparkling clean and pillows wrapped my tired mind in comfort. You can have a perfect room but without the great staff, it's just a room. The Warwick is a five star hotel made affordable for a working class person. The guys at the front door were fun and directed me wherever I asked. The concierge provided maps and was a veritable search engine with a smile. I have found my hotel where I can always go, count on down to earth yet completely professional staff. Forgive the length of this review but, to say any less would have been dishonest. Thank you Warwick, I cannot wait to return. You made my trip one to remember. Feel free to use my name.

VWe were very pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. The hotel has recently undergone a $200 million renovation and reopened in February. It shows. From the muted colors and earthy tones of the lobby, hallways and rooms this is simple elegance. Everything in the room can be controlled from a bedside touch screen. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, the room spacious (400 sq.ft.). The location was perfect for the theatre district. Surprisingly there was NO noise from Times Square. The staff were wonderful and went out of their way to make sure all of our needs were met. The courtesy car was an extra amenity as well. I would recommend this hotel without reservation and plan on returning.

The bathroom was large and included a hi-tech toilet,which my son loved playing with the settings on.\u000aRoom service was good - again a good deal compared to previous experiences in the city.\u000aWe only stayed one night, but I would highly recommend it and plan to stay again next time I'm in the city.

VFor the price we paid ($600!!!) I was very disappointed with our stay. The room was clean and stylish, but our view was of a warehouse roof, the breakfast that was included was nothing more than a shotglass of juice, a tiny cup of tinned fruit and some cold toast with butter and jam. We were expecting a lot more than that! The location was certainly not the best in NYC - we were in the middle of a car repair/taxi/gas station area, miles from a subway. Noise from the street was noticable.\u000aWe were not happy that wifi was $10, for the price you pay for the room it should be included. We found staff did a lot of chatting among themselves, ignoring us, despite us giving good tips and clearly being after their assistance! The only person who was friendly and seemed interested was the head concierge, Jeffrey, who wanted us to give a review on Trip Advisor. Here it is.\u000aWe would never go back there again.

VAll i can say about this hotel is..... DON'T DO IT, DON'T STAY HERE !!!!\u000aWe arranged a weeks trip to NYC and because we wanted to see all the sights, NY scene etc, we came over this hotel on the website and it was very reasonably priced and looked a stylish and comfortable hotel.\u000aWhere they got the photos from for the rooms i don't know. The check-in and little seating area is fine, the pictures are true. The rooms are not!\u000aI had read that they were renovating so when I booked (9 months ago so in which time you'd think the renovating of rooms would've been finished) i asked for a renovated room as the trip was for my birthday.\u000aWhen we checked in, after walking in through a small door and up 3 fights of stairs, it looked okay until they walked us to our room. Shabby! The room was awful. Very small, dark, no wardrobe, table, vanity area, the bathroom was dirty and dim.\u000aWe complained and asked for a renovated room and they kindly moved us to a better room...... that was just as BAD! Slightly larger but the same, no wardrobe, no storage, and two nicely folded "grey" towels.\u000aWhere they have taken the bedroom pictures from i do not know. We complained and said that we were going to check out as we couldn't stay there. One night might have been manageable but for 5, no way. How could you unpack with no where to put anything?\u000aWe were in the hotel for a a total of 20 minutes and they charged us anyway when we left.\u000aMy only regret is that i didn't unpack enough to get my camera out so that I could post pictures for people to see.\u000aWe were very lucky to get into a lovely hotel how took pity on us and the area was so much better.\u000aHope this helps anyone and please ask any questions.

VMy family and I stayed here for a three day stay-cation. We live just over the river in northern New Jersey and wanted to experience the tourist side of New York. However, we wanted a modern, cool, and luxury hotel to call home while we lived the life of a tourist. The knickerbocker surpassed all of our expectations and then some. The service was like nothing I've experienced before. Every person we would interact with was thrilled to speak to us and always went above and beyond to make our stay even better. My kids loved the view of Times Square and my wife loved the HUGE bathroom. Every day before our escapades, we would grab a free water from the room and a coffee from the cafe and go on with our day. Upon our return we were always greeted with smiles and open arms. Nightly turn down service was a beautiful touch, and all of the free items in the bathroom were so well thought out (hair ties, cufflinks, a tide pen....) on our last night, we went up to the rooftop garden. Such breath taking views and incredible drinks. Did i mention that the service was also amazing up there, too!\u000aNot a single detail was missed on this trip.

There is a bar with a great young barmaid who was a very good server, but another time a different barmaid would not serve us two buds even though there was some in the bar refrigerator and suggested we cross the street to buy them from a store, she said she only served wine ! .

VI stayed here for a weekend trip with a friend. I thought the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The rooms were also a very decent size for a NYC hotel! We drove to the hotel and had the valet park our car, and I thought it was very convenient and quick. Check-in and check-out was also very easy and quick. On the last day after we checked out we had the hotel hold our luggage while we did some last minute sight-seeing. The staff was very helpful and helped us with what we needed. The downsides of the hotel-- the elevators took a VERY long time, especially during the morning. The other downside was the breakfast room. It was VERY crowded and a lot of the food was gone when we were there. There was an outside eating area but it was raining and we couldn't make use of that extra space. One night we also went up to the rooftop bar. It was a great view, but it should be open later!\u000aOverall, I would stay here again. A somewhat large room, free breakfast, and a rooftop bar- you can't beat it!

Obviously I am nitpicking but I can't provide a perfect score if the stay wasn't perfect. Overall though, I enjoyed my stay and would return in the future.

VVery unhappy with this hotel! The rooms were extremely small the beds were more like doubles rather then kings! The place was dirty, it was 90 degrees out and you could only turn down a/c to a certain point. The breakfast was lousy herded into extra small dining room, had to wait to get a seat, the food was all microwaved cooked. I said to the manager that the place was nothing like the pictures, her reply was " thats how we get you in" there was no security in front, anyone could access the elevator walking in from the street, a accident waiting to happen! If something already has! I would never stay again, wish i had stayed with The Plaza my original pick, for the extra 50 bucks, but the pictures and breakfast changed my mind stupid move on my part! Even paid extra for a view, which that stunk! No pool, no restaurant, if you want these amenities don't stay here!

VWhat a great hotel. There is a good reason why it rates so highly - basically it is spot on. They do all the important things well and they add some extras too. I took my wife here to celebrate her 40th birthday so I was more than usually concerned that it would fit the bill. I need not have worried. The welcome was great, they arranged a limo from JFK for me, and laid on a bottle of fizz for us on arrival. The room (we booked a suite - we were on the 9th floor) was really nice, very clean, with fresh clean linen and nice towels. They even change the shower curtain between guests. There was a large TV in each of our rooms along with a DVD player. Our room had a balcony out onto Park Avenue which was great - I'd cetainly recommed this room, but I've no reason to believe any of the other rooms wouldn't be just as good. If you want the NY atmosphere then a room on the Park Avenue side is brilliant, but it is a bit more noisy, given that it's on one of the main avenues in Manhatten, I would guess it would be a little quieter on the 26th street side, but to be honest it didn't bother us at all. The free wine and cheese every evening is very welcome after a long day pounding the streets of NYC, and the breakfast was also included which was basically a continental breakfast. I can recommend the espresso, which is available at any time. Another thing which was very helpful was a hotel PC with a printer which is available (yet again, for free) in the lobby. The wireless is free and reliable. On top of that the hotel is three blocks from the Flatiron building and about six from the Empire State. It's two blocks from the closest subway station. The staff are very helpfu, especially the people who look after breakfast and the evening reception. It's not big and grand, it's small and beautiful and we will definitely go back.

VI had never stayed in Tribeca before and was completely charmed by it; I usually stay at the Mercer but have found that Soho can sometimes be very crowded and busy. Tribeca does not have anything like the same number of shops and, as a result, it has a much more laid back feel. And this hotel is just such a relaxing place to stay. The rooms are very nicely done; the bathrooms are gorgeous, but most of all the bar and courtyard reserved for guests are ideal places to while away the time insulated from the hustle and bustle of New York. And the food in the courtyard is excellent too.\u000aI liked the way one could walk up to Soho in 10 minutes or over to the waterfront (with its fabulous views) in 5. I loved all the restaurants nearby especially Harrison which always seemed to be buzzing with happy diners. But if I wanted to stay in, there was always the courtyard to retreat to and it was especially magical lamplit at night-time.\u000aI did not find the staff to be at all offputting (as other reviewers have suggested)- they were generally very professional and warm.\u000aIf I had a complaint it was that I thought the sound proofing was poor for a hotel of this standard but earplugs at night blocked out the noise of creaking wooden doors and corridors and also the occasional noise of traffic outside. And I suppose that noise is one of the occupational hazards of a city like New York.

VWe stayed at the Hotel Metro for five nights at the beginning of July. Our room was a Contemporary Queen and more compact than anticipated but had everything we needed plus some extras not always available within the room price in New York such as a fridge and a free safe and wifi. The maid service was excellent. Our room was on the third floor and at the back of the hotel and the only downside was the noisy air conditioning but it wasn't a problem for us after the first night. The complementary breakfast was also a bonus, there was a complementary wine reception every evening and complementary tea and coffee at any time. The hotel concierge service was excellent and we got some great tips for getting around town. The hotel is in a great location pretty much as close as you could get to the Empire Satate Building and the roof terrace view is awesome. We loved the touch of old New York styling in the communal areas of the building which added to the whole experience. This was our first visit to NYC can. We are sure we will come again and I wouldn't hesitate to return to this wonderful gem of a hotel.

VWe stayed at the Warwick hotel from August 15-19. There were constant lines at the counter to check-in and check-out, with often people complaining about something. Even though we checked in early and left our luggage with the concierge, our rooms were still not ready at 6:30 pm later that evening. When we did get our rooms, they were not adjoining as requested and dirty, especially the curtains which had black soot on them. After complaining, we were given adjoining rooms the next day right in front of the elevators, which were noisy. In addition, during the last two nights, there was a horrible smoke smell entering one of our rooms, probably from the room below. The bathrooms are small, the views are of other taller buildings right across the street and this was for about $300 per room. I will never stay there again. The only good thing was the location.\u000a

VLook, I agree with most outsiders coming from abroad to NYC. This place is old, a bit dilapidated and some of the people carry that unwelcoming New York attitude. I get it. But I rate it highly because I love the quaintness about it and hope to goodness it never changes. If you want updated rooms, demand the 14th floor. For me, I'll happily take 13th as I have nearly 100 times since 2012. I love this place because it's safe, is practically in the absolute best location in all of Manhattan adjacent to Penn Station, and is very appropriately priced. All things considered it has the best value for money.\u000aI have to give a personal shout out to Maria "B" though. When I come here and stand in line, I wait for her to check me in because she knows me best. There was about a year-long break while not coming to NYC and upon my return, she recognized me instantly. Nothing more can be expressed as a "welcome back" than something like that and so I am saddened when I arrive and she is not at the counter.\u000aI am a repeat customer and on seldom occasion I do use other hotels in Manhattan during times when booking a single night is not available. All other times, including as I type this, I choose this hotel. Old, dilapidated, but plenty clean and perfect when combined with accessibility to the rest of the city.

VThis was a great hotel tucked around the corner from the heart of Times Square. We had a voucher for breakfast with our room, and the hotel restaurant was exquisite. Otherwise I wish I could say more about our hotel, but we didnt' spend much time there. You're in the city that never sleeps, go out and do some things.\u000aThe only other thing I will say is that the internet connection was very pricey.

VMy wife and I had 5 day break in New York for her 60th birthday and we were due to return on the night that Sandy hit NY. Having been virtually abandoned by British Airways and finding our travel agent to be almost ineffective in the chaos that ensued it was a fantastic relief to find all the hotel staff simply couldn't do enough for us to ease the pain. We were given free wifi for a number of days, we were given free access to a hotel phone in the lobby to get hold of BA and we were given every courtesy possible during our 6 (YES SIX) extra nights that we stayed there. We were given a more reasonable room rate than the rack rate too for the enforced stay - we simply couldn't have asked for more! In the days that followed Sandy the staff maintained a reduced but very effective (and friendly) service to customers. Very well done to all the staff you were brilliant!

On arrival to the room there was a hand written welcome note and a bottle of wine. This was just the start of the fabulous service that pervaded the entire trip. The staff were so helpful, the food in the restaurant delicious, and it is just 2 blocks from Central Park, and a 10 minute walk to Times Square, less than that to Broadway making it a perfect location. Despite its proximity to everything, the rooms are a peaceful haven. Cant wait to go back.

VThere is no doubting the great location of this hotel it's so convenient. I like most was disappointed with the rooms, they are very small and the bathrooms are minuscule. Our rooms were quite tired. We like others arrived very late in the evening after a long flight and travel disruptions getting to hotel. Do reception staff not realise this? One of our party of 4 was not able to make the trip so we telephoned the booking agent to change the reservation on the day, which was fine but did get a shirty response at reception after the long journey with a 'I'll see if I can do anything' is that a control issue? Consequently I think as I was abrupt in my response our party of 4 were on separate floors and In the rooms directly opposite the lifts. They aren't the best obviously. The $15 per day per room is irritating too, for facilities( wifi and use off the gym) most hotels offer these facilities within the hotel package so be aware of this addional charge. All in all it was okay, the doorman at this hotel is extremely helpful and friendly though

VI have heard of airlines losing luggage but hotels?\u000aIntercontinental did. When they finally located it, I had already left NYC. They then sent it by the cheapest economy courier they could find, leading to an additional 5 day delay before it arrived at my home.\u000aThe hotel manager offered a future free upgrade as recompense for this. However when I tried to take advantage of this, they denied the request.\u000aI understand mistakes happen but the way they handled the followup clearly illustrates that customer service is not a priority.

The women at the front desk even remember me, which after a long flight means all the difference and I know that if I need anything at all they have it covered.

Everywhere is in easy walking distance or you could get the metro. I think we visited all the major sights the 5 days we were there but visiting the 9/11 memorial site was the highlights of our trip.\u000aThe period decorations of the hotel and the reception staff were wonderful.

The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are spotless, quiet and the beds are excellent. the decor may not be the hippest in town, but rooms and the hotel in general is very clean and location is fantastic.

With a family of four we literally had to move out of each others way to make it around the beds to bathroom. Obviously this wasnt the best situation, but the kids and my wife took in stride. We were there to spend time out in the city, not in the room anyhow.\u000aThe room itself was clean,not the quietest, but it really wasnt a problem for one night. We did have the complemtary breakfast which was welcome, but not what I would expect from this hotel either.\u000aOne issue did occur. My wife (being pregnant at the time) requested more pillows to better support herself at night. After two calls, no one ever delivered the pillows.

Lovely food through at the restaurant, with 15% off for hotel guests which is great. Would definitely stay here again!\u000aCons: Heating unit in the room was quite loud.

Giselle at check in was SUPER nice....so friendly and very helpful. She was also there when I left and helped me with the car service. The breakfast at this hotel is standard fare for Holiday Inn Express, but the breakfast area is pretty tight and usually crowded. I end up grabbing breakfast from a place across the street and that works just fine. The room is pretty small, but has everything I need as a business traveler. It'd be super tight with more than one person, so not sure if I'd recommend it for other than business travel. Not sure where you'd even put a second suitcase?

Normally, the hotel we choose really lays out the red carpet for us, not the case at the IHG Times Square. This is a very busy hotel and it seems the goal of the staff and management is to get people in and out. I'm a platinum ambassador with IHG and was treated like it was my first and only stay with IHG. I've had wonderful experiences at other properties. So.....we checked out after one night and went to the Conrad near Downtown. This is not a typical Intercontinental experience.

VI stayed here with my friend as it was recommended to me by travel agents, this was supposed to be a special celebration for my friends 50th birthday, we walked in our first room and I before I went right into the room, I knew it was dirty, there was nothing clean about this room, the bed covers were completely stained, the desk was all sticky, the toilet and bath looked as though they had not been cleaned in months, to top all this off there was sick all over the heater, wall and carpet, we went to reception to complain, I had taken photos of all this and tried to show receptionist and he would not look, he tried to get me to pay extra for an upgrade to which I showed him my original booking to show I had already paid for a superior room, he was very rude and just gave me Keys to another room, this room was better but not great the only thing that made us stay in this room was clean beds, carpets in corridors were not hoovered the whole duration of our stay as there were peanuts all over the place and remained there 4 days later,\u000aStay well away from this hotel it is disgusting.

VI would recommend this hotel to travelers coming to NYC. Not being from this area and because it was my first visit to the city I have nothing to compare to with other hotels. Wish we could have had more time to spend. If you do come, visit the upstairs bar on floor 16. Don't think it was advertised but was a great find for us. I happened across it while searching for the ice dispenser.

VI took my daughter to NYC for a concert at the Beacon Theater. NYLO is 2 blocks away so that was good. The lobby had lots of couches and a cute bar. We got in around 10pm on Friday night. We entered our room on the second floor. Maybe my daughter was used to staying at Kimpton Hotels, but immediately she had a bad feeling about the room. It was very boxy. Comfortable bed but the shower was dirty, the sink had no counter area and there was no mini-bar. I guess I didn't do my homework. I had to order roomservice but that only comes from the Semolina resturant attached to the hotel. And they don't send up a glass of wine. I don't get it.\u000aOn Saturday before the concert I decided that we would have appetizers in the lobby. We had a full hour before we had to go to the concert. I ordered 2 appeitzers and we just sat there and waited and waited. Meanwhile watching all the other bigger parties of people be served on quickly. Finally I gave up and told the host that we had to leave. She didn't understand that an 8 1/2 year old girl gets hungry and going to a concert like that is not good. I prayed that the theater had food. Dinner was chips, pretzels, popcorn and m&M's. We had to order roomservice again at 11:00pm because my girl was starving for real food.\u000aI only stayed here because of the proximity to the Beacon Theatre. I won't stay here again.\u000aOnly good thing is Semolina's breakfast. Big big breakfasts that satisfy. Food is much better at the resturant than for room service.

VThis was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I actually Have a lovely apartment in NYC, but had some out of town guests come and offered them my apartment as they were a large family. I thought, oh how fun I'll stay at some of the hotels I always wanted to try out so I can recommend when people ask where they should stay. Well !! The hotel is dark and it's hard to see. Staff is friendly, but not overly eager. Lobby is super small as are elevators. My room was on the 3rd floor right above the entrance to the hotel. I can't believe they would rent this room to anyone!! It was seriously like actually being on the street. It was so loud, not only from the traffic, but from the people coming in and out of the hotel, etc. I swear I didn't sleep a wink. The garbage trucks, the taxis, the doors slamming, the people drunk who were leaving the hotel and restaurant. Oh my god ! The worst !!! This was not some 200 or 300 dollar room this was over $1000.00 !!!! Like I said I live in the city, I live in a very busy area, but I only sometimes hear just a bit of noise. Worst experience ever. I will not go back, nor will i ever recommend to anyone ever ! Charging that much money for that room is a crime !!!!

VThe Algonquin Hotel has loads of tradition, one of their traditions is to is to have a cat in the lobby that has the run of the place, the practice dates to the 1930s, hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a theatrical name, (as the hotel is blocks away from the theatre district), so it was named Hamlet, whenever the hotel has a male, he carries on the name; females are named, Matilda. A " Matilda" is currently prowling the property and she is a beauty...as is The Algonquin. I was a resident of New York City for many years and often visited the lobby for a drink or to see someone perform in their showroom. I now live in California and recently chose to stay at The Algonquin for a few nights. Delightful. My room was very comfortable and the employees were eager to please...can\u2019t ask for much more of a hotel. I enjoyed it\u2019s charm and it\u2019s landmark provenance...and the sight of Matilda lounging on her mini chaise, never failed to amuse me.

VI am an Ambassador member and The Intercontinental Times Square is my go-to hotel when I visit Manhattan. Overall it is a very good stay. The service is at the excellent level I have experienced at their other hotels across the world, but it is good.\u000aI just returned from a two-night stay at this property. Check-in was quick at the main desk and the desk clerk confirm late checkout and free pay-per-view movie due to my Ambassador status. Room was clean and the location is perfect. Walking distance to Times Square and most importantly, Shake Shack is just around the corner.\u000aMy only two minor negative experiences at this hotel was we were locked out of the room/elevator on the final day. Despite the clerk confirming late check out the final day, the keys were not programmed as such. A quick stop at the front desk and another clerk fixed the problem.\u000aThe other negative experience was I did not realize until reviewing my credit card statement after my trip was that I was charged $7 for something out of the minibar. I did not use the minibar. I did notice when I viewed at check-in that someone left a plastic gelato cup in the minibar. Thinking the guests prior left it in there on accident, I took it out and threw it away. The items in the minibar have RFID sensors so that you are charged for an item after it is removed for 10 seconds. Apparently the disgraceful losers staying in the $300 a night room prior to me were to cheap to pay for a $7 beverage so they took the beverage out and replaced it with plastic gelato cup in hopes not being charged for it. I guess housekeeping did not check the minibar while turning over the room.\u000aOverall, I would probably stay here again, but may consider the newly renovated Intercontinental Barclays.

For me it lived up to my expectations, had a king suite on the 26th street side so very little noise, really spacious, clean and well maintained during the stay. The breakfast service was great even when it was busy extra tables were put in the area, really great customer service from all the staff I encountered. The location was great being a little out of the way of some of the busy spots but near enough to get around without any trouble. I really hope to visit New York again and will definitely look to stay at Hotel Giraffe when I do.

VWe stayed at this hotel while exhibiting at the Fancy Food Show. We\u000ave stayed here before and really enjoy the hotel and the service. We usually check in early and there's never been a wait for the room, probably because we're with the show. The rooms are smaller but very well appointed and most importantly, very clean. The bathrooms and very nice with a large shower and the beds are always very comfortable. They have a rooftop bar that is just phenomenal, from the views to the service. Kareem the bartender is absolutely the best! They have a small sundries area ext to the check in desk where you can get sodas, water and snacks. While it's certainly convenient, $4.65 for a soda is ridiculous, even for Manhattan. Avoid this Market and go to the Duane Reade at the corner. That's the only downside I see for this hotel. Since we were with the show, we paid a reduced rate of $208/night. I see the normal rate is much higher but I can't speak to exactly how it would be for others. YMMV. We plan to stay here any time we do the show. It's a great place!

VWe stayed at the IC Times Square from 28th December to 3rd January, 2 rooms. On arrival we were disappointed to find that the rooms had not been allocated, one was available (we arrived around 1.30pm) and the other would be on a different floor. We asked if this could be revisited, particularly in that I had emailed the hotel specifically to request adjacent rooms and early check in, due to our flight arrival. We returned at 4pm, as requested, and a room had been found on the same floor, although not next to each other.\u000aI was also very disappointed that a request had not been dealt with, and was not progressed throughout our stay. The visit was for my nieces' 18th birthday, and I had asked via email for cakes to be arranged (for which I offered to pay). I'd received two confirmations by email that this would be arranged but sadly not.\u000aThe rooms were fine, on the 6th floor, which could be noisy at times but did not disturb our sleep. They were kept spotlessly clean and contained all that would be required, save for a kettle (important to many of us Brits!) These are charged at $10 per room per stay. The air con worked well, always hot water, great shower. Room service was extortionate e.g. $20 for two glasses of milk, including tray charge/delivery.\u000aWe had joined the IHG Reward Club, so received free wifi which was excellent. Had we not done so, there would have been a charge, which is surprising.\u000aThe hotel is ideally located, with a subway station next door and supermarkets nearby - for milk!\u000aThe third disappointment was that on New Years Eve, many roads were closed in the area, and we were unable to walk easily back to the hotel due to this. Others we spoke to had been made fully aware by their hotels that this would be the case, but we received nothing. We were asked for ID before passing through certain areas and luckily had this with us. What should have been a 15 minute walk turned into one and a half hours, which left us irritated that the hotel management had failed to give us any warning.\u000aI appreciate that this review contains negative points, but if the price was right I would return there due to convenience of location, cleanliness and good room facilities. It is a shame that issues of check in, special request and road closures were not adequately dealt with.\u000aI would also add that the concierge were great, always helpful, efficient and friendly.

The location is nice, couple of blocks to time sqaure/theater district/subway etc. The rooms however are tiny....I know that is not unusual in NYC but I am comparing to my previous hampton inn stays. Tiny!! Bed against one wall....bed against the other wall and a nightstand 8 inches wide in the middle. The staff was super friendly and the place was clean just really cramped.

VStayed here for a first (and probably only) family visit to NY, so wanted somewhere a bit special and in a great location with two children in tow.\u000aHad originally booked a room on the lower floors (not the very lowest, but one price band up) and then decided to take out Intercontinental Ambassador status for additional cost before making the trip as this guaranteed a room upgrade to the next band and a couple of other niceties on arrival such as fresh fruit and designated check in desk.\u000aHowever, was when arrived we were told that there were no upgrades available due to the number of people staying over the busy bank holiday weekend period. When we informed the receptionist that we had paid for the additional Ambassador status purely for the upgrade they moved us to another even higher room (floor 32) with windows on two sides for the first evening then back down to the original upgrade the following day to floor 29.\u000aThis was all done with the minimum of fuss and the baggage moves were handled internally the following day by the hotel staff.\u000aThe hotel itself was excellent, with a wonderful reception and bar area and helpful staff. Both our rooms were excellent and the views breathtaking. Definitely worth paying that bit extra if possible for the higher floors in NY. The hotel room, whilst not particulalrly large, was more than adequate with enough room even with the two double beds for a family of four to move around and sit on the chairs provided to watch the large screen HD tvs in each room.\u000aThe only downside was the ridiculously expensive mini bar and snacks - $5 for a bag of peanuts and $25 for a half bottle of wine. Needless to say this was left well alone by us, but be careful not to knock any of the items that were located on the desk tops as they were electronically triggered if moved and the price automatically added to the hotel bill.\u000aThe room had an excellent bathroom with a wonderful walk-in 'Rain Shower' which was a much welcomed luxury after pounding the NY streets for a few hours.\u000aOverall, a great stay. We felt safe at all times both in the hotel and with the excellent location right on the edge of Times Square - near enough to feel the 'buzz' but just away from the noise and lights. That said, with our floor height I doubt we'd have been troubled even if we were situated right in the middle of TS!\u000aFor any first time visitors to NY, especially with youngish children, this is a fantastic hotel to use as a base, with the added bonus of having a Shake Shack restaurant underneath if you fancy grabbing a burger or shake to bring back to the room and eat whilst admiring the city views.

VI love staying in boutiques hotels when I visit large cities. Living in New Jersey, I enjoy going into New York City for dinner or shows and usually spend the night in a boutique hotel. Before Christmas, my husband and I met friends for dinner and I booked a room in the Ink 48. I was sooo impressed with the whole experience. All the staff were friendly and accommodating.Perfect example, we had a problem with the heat in our room and called the front desk. Within minutes, an hvac engineer named Angel (and he was) knocked on our door. He tried unsuccessfully fixing the unit and called to have our room changed. He returned five minutes later with a key to our new room and a complimentary bottle of wine AND he carried our bags to the new room. That's what I call service. The rooms are rather spacious for a boutique hotel and very comfortable. The hotel also offers a complimentary wine tasting every evening. It was nice to have a glass of wine and meet other hotel guests while waiting for our friends to arrive. We then visited the rooftop bar which also was a treat. The view is spectacular and wonderful service. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that likes a personalized and top notch service.

VWith all the rave reviews this hotel got I was expecting a real charmer. What I got was a tiny room and very average service. No doubt this hotel has a great location and is clean but thats about it. If your expecting charm FORGET ABOUT IT! For three nights I ended up paying about $975, a bit steep for a tiny room and tinier bathroom. I could not help but think the Comfort Inn across the street must have been cheaper and offered at least the same level of accomodation (it would have been physically impossible for the rooms to be smaller.) Again nothing terribly wrong with the place, I was just expecting more based on all the great reviews. As for the much vaunted breakfast, OJ and muffins with some not so great bagels (I was born in NY I know bagels.) If it was cheaper I might come back, but as I doubt prices will be falling I will be moving on to greener pastures for my next visit.\u000a

The room was tastefully decorated, nicely furnished, comfy beds, good sized bathroom with quality products, plenty of towels and snuggly robes. Room not huge but big enough for my grandson and I to share without tripping over each other. Staff friendly, pleasant, welcoming and helpful. We walked easily to Times Square, all the way down to SOHO, past Washington Square Park - good for people watching, and the High Line a little gem NYC should be proud of.

VMy wife and I were in NYC early December 2013, to experience the Christmas magic the city is famous for - It delivered in bucket loads. I wanted to get some great pictures of the NYC skyline at night and the concierge of our hotel (The Sanctuary) recommended paying a visit to this rooftop bar. What a great place to take some fantastic pictures and also enjoy a drink in a really relaxing atmosphere. This is a great kept secret for photographers and provides a different angle from which to get a view of the city. A 'must do' on your list of things to do in New York!\u000aIt must be remembered that we did not stay at this hotel and so cannot provide information / review the other facilities.

VI loved my stay at this charming hotel. My adult son joined me (we were visiting another son who lived in the city) and we all really liked Hotel Giraffe. Its location is really convenient with lots to do within walking distance. Our king suite was great for 2 of us with a comfortable pull out sofa. The free breakfast was perfect with such nice service and I loved the afternoon happy hour. David at the front desk was so nice and helpful~ suggesting nearby restaurants and getting us show tickets. I have already booked two more stays to visit my son.I think this hotel is a real find in a city with lots of properties.

VThis was my second stay at the Algonquin Hotel. Last time, we received a free upgrade to a suite. This time, it was during fashion week and the series of horrible storms, so they were fully booked. They did offer an upgrade to a king size room, but it faced the street on a low level and they warned us it could be noisy during early morning trash pickup. We stayed with the queen size room. The room was small, about what I see when I go to Europe and much of NYC is like that, but comfortable and beautifully updated. The staff was always gracious and helpful. However, one of my favorite parts of the hotel is the lobby. It is filled with people enjoying cocktails and talking from late afternoon until late evening. I love the old school feel and charm of this hotel, and the price has always been good even though it's located in a very prime area. Sometimes, I will choose a hotel for price because I am not able to stomach paying $500 plus per night. While I would put this in the box of hotels to choose for price, I can honestly say that I would also choose it over any of the other more modern hotels in a heartbeat even if price is not a consideration. I will continue to return!

Though probably not a good place if you have to ark a car.\u000aRoom is high standard and clean as was the batheroom.\u000aThough there is not really not a lot of space, it has rather a claustrophobic feel to it, room and corridors. There is no lobby as such just a buffet breakfast area that might double as a lobby. Though breakfast is included it is limited and rather crowded.

VI recently stayed at the 4 Points Sheraton in Chelsea - very convenient location - I am an artist and wanted to be close to the Chelsea galleries. The rooms are basic, but clean and comfortable. Not terribly noisy except when the garbage is collected. Close to public transport and a quick cab ride if you want to go to the theatre. If you are looking for a hotel with lots of extras, this is probably not it, however if you are looking for something clean, affordable and fairly central then this is very good value. Less crowded than Times Square - you feel as if you are getting a real taste of New York. Across the road on the corner of 7th avenue and West 24th is a real good organic grocery store - they have a take away salad bar that is really good if you are looking for fresh vegetables and are tired of greasy take aways, they also have lots of fresh fruit and a deli. Quick walk to the +-250 art galleries in the district.

Hotel is well located very close to Empire State Building and just off 5th Avenue. Its a quiet enough area being close enough to Times Square Grand Central station etc (10 mins walk) but also far enough away to be quiter for well earned sleep without much noise.\u000aStaff very friendly.\u000aSmall bar at front of hotel next to reception which was handy for a late / early drink before or after going out to eat at night.\u000aPlenty of places for Breakfast nearby.\u000aOverall an excellent place that I would return to and recommend to others.

VThe Paramount is really an interesting place. One of the most beautiful lobbies you'll see anywhere, a full refurbishment, a terrific location if you're doing anything related to Times Square/Theatre district or just looking to be in midtown, and generally a friendly, helpful staff. It's also idiosyncratic - one of the darkest hotels in which I've ever stayed (the lobby is vampire friendly at 11 am, and it's almost laughingly dark in the elevators to the point where the numbers are hard to see), the rooms are postage-stamp sized but fairly typical for a boutique hotel in NY (and are clean, albeit quite spartan), the workout facility is small and cramped, an d there are small things like the coffee shop doesn't open until 7 am (in NY??). I also had a bad experience with the concierge, who made a recommendation for dinner (was looking for mexican food) and sent me to a little hellhole of a place located in Hell's Kitchen that had no liquor license and had seating for about four people. Pleasant surprises included a meal I had (try the waffle-ized chicken sandwich, strange though it sounds), and a cozy and - of course - hyper-dark lounge. It's an aesthetically striking facility that gets even better on closer inspection - just sitting in the lobby to check email, people-watch and relax is a wonderful experience - and I'd go back. Sun glasses definitely not needed indoors!

The 'family room' was great for accomodating my family and I as we took my mom to NYC for a celebration of her 65th birthday!\u000aLocation is superb.. short walk to Empire State Building, Macys, Fashion District sites and New York Public Library. Bryant Park not too far either - slightly longer but very manageable walk to TImes Square and Broadway plays. Jimmy's around the corner was recommended by the doorman and had good all day food choices.\u000aHotel was always clean. We had a problem with our toilet not flushing the first morning and maintaince was up within 5 minutes of us calling. The TVs didn't always work exactly as intended but someone came to look at that as well and we weren't in the room long enough to truly care about it anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Hotel Metro again.

VWe visit Manhattan every December, and just returned from our first stay at the Hotel Giraffe. We are already referring to it as "our new place." The young staff is friendly and eager to please. As a couple traveling with two "children" (rather large ones who are in college and high-school), the Giraffe worked quite well for all of us. We found the Terrace one-bedroom suite to be reasonably priced, spacious enough, and quiet. My husband and I agreed that the king bed was extremely comfortable and we loved the little balcony. Housekeeping was spot on. The neighborhood surrounding Park/26th is a combination of office and residential space, and a short walk in any direction leads you to an array of restaurant choices in all price ranges; the area feels "real" and not touristy. We enjoyed the complimentary wine/cheese offered in the evening, as well as the continental breakfast, both of which are served in the Giraffe lobby, and on one evening we were entertained by a pianist performing on the lobby's Yamaha grand. The lobby space is contemporary, fresh, and inviting. It may not be your cup of tea if you desire the opulence of the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons lobby, but I must say that the Giraffe guests sipping their wine and coffee struck me as uniformly more happy, relaxed and gracious than many of those I have observed passing through the lobby of the grand five-star hotels. We will be back!

The room and bathroom were huge for an older hotel. The location is awesome, we were able to walk practically everywhere. The hotel is literally 2-3blks from Central Park, so my husband and daughter went out and ran the park. If we go back to NYC, we will definitely stay here again!

We were very pleased with this hotel; decor is fresh and modern, rooms are spacious and clean, the AC worked well, and the staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance from Grand Central Station, shopping, and many local bars and restaurants. The only thing that would make it a little better would be coffee makers in the rooms, but otherwise, it was a great experience.

The stairs squeaked and the floor sloped. If you are the complaining type, this hotel is not for you!! But if you want to explore the city by day and come to the room to sleep at night, this place is perfect. Bonus - there's a wine shop next door!\u000aI would stay again...and I am!

VLeave your shoes at home because there\u2019s nowhere to store them in the miniscule cupboards in these otherwise modern and functional rooms. I left mine on the floor and travelling alone I could barely store the rest of my clothes. If there's more than one of you someone is going to have to live out of their suite case during your stay at the Hyatt Union Square. Apart from this and the open plan bathroom, where you are sleeping in reach of the vanity basin (the toilet and great shower have doors) it brand new, slick with dark wood floors great bed and plenty of good lighting. The rooms are very small, though mine had a courtyard larger than the room, unfortunately I couldn\u2019t use it in winter but still gave the room a larger feel. It's new and is nice and the staf are helpful and it doesn\u2019t feel like a chain hotel more boutique feel than cookie cutter feel. Service was excellent a faulty bedside light was fixed promptly and the location is superb. Forget staying around the touristy Times Square as Union Square is much more interesting with twice a week farmer markets, tons of great restaurants and most subway lines that will get you pretty much anywhere. The hotel has what looks like a great whisky bar and a restaurant, which I didn\u2019t try...there\u2019s too many choices on the streets nearby. The location itself makes this hotel a good choice, if you don\u2019t mind small rooms, its very well run, very clean and practically and tastefully designed.

Everything in our room looked brand new and was immaculate. The curtains kept the room perfectly dark and fairly quiet, even with the early morning trash pickup. The complementary brunch was perfect: bagels, toast, yogurt, pancakes, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, omelets, sausage, lots of juice, a selection of teas and pretty good coffee! It was amply stocked both early in the morning and just before closing. The staff at the front desk and in the brunch area were polite and professional.

VThis was my first time visiting New York and the Jewel was a nice hotel. We were on the 11th floor and had one of only 4 hotel rooms that had a balcony, which was really nice. We stayed Dec 1-6 and overall had a pleasant experience. I was surprised at how small the hotel room was, but that seems to be a standard for New York. The room was very clean and we did have a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and iPod charger in the room. With our room facing 51st Street and with a balcony we did hear a lot of noise from the street below, but again, I think that\u2019s going to happen in such a crazy city! We arrived before our 3 PM check in time, and the room wasn\u2019t ready, but they held our bags for us and had them waiting in our room when we came back at 3:00 to check in. The staff was always pleasant. Right out the front door you could see Rockefeller Plaza and the Christmas tree. It was only a 10 minute walk to Times Square, which was one of my favorite places. All in all it was a good experience and I would stay again and recommend to a friend.

I'm sure a quiet room is available upon request--we enjoyed the flashing lights for this trip. We were in town for a concert at "The Garden" and the location was perfect for walking home late at night. The bellmen though, are the best. The guys that help hail cabs, manage bags, and find my Uber driver are the best. They made me feel SO SAFE! They felt like very competent bodyguards. Overall, it appears that the management hires exceptionally talented staff. They were all smart and on top of the details. The rooms were spacious as well. I highly recommend this hotel if you wish to be near Times Square. Also, the room service coffee arrives QUICKLY, HOT and STRONG. So very worth it . . . .

It was in a good location just next to the Empire State Building and a deli with everything you could want for breakfast.with other good restaurants nearby for dinner. It felt safe and accessible to underground to visit the rest of New York. Best to buy return tickets as some stations don't have machines which take cash.\u000aThe only drawback was that we were told we would get a large twin room with a view when booking but ,upon arrival they gave us a smaller one, & we were told we would need to pay quite a bit extra a night for the larger beds and view. So get any promises like this confirmed by email.\u000aAnother tip is that Moma (museum of modern art)has free entry on Friday nights and the Staten Island Ferry (used by locals for work) is a free trip past the statue of liberty & Brooklyn Bridge.

VWe stayed here 3 nights on our honeymoon in late 2013 and I've only just become a TripAdvisor reviewer so thought I'd cover it off. I loved the thought of this hotel. It's so very NY and quite reflective of my personal style. The Greenwich lived up to expectations but made us feel somewhat uncomfortable. It didn't feel natural for us. Everyone seemed to be trying just that bit too hard to be more effortlessly chic than the next. Maybe that's a reflection of my husband and I, but that's how we felt. When you pay that sort of money for a hotel I think you grow to expect that some things are simply part of the service... We had some fairly pricey surprises come from simple things like ordering a morning coffee or getting some sock and jocks laundered. We also experienced really pretentious service from a young upstart at Locanda Verde. He seemed more interested in attending to tables of single women than topping up our glasses of Barolo! I must finish on a positive note... Our room was cosy but a beautifully assembled mix of pieces clearly curated by someone who knows what they're doing. The spa was also to die for. I had a 2 hour massage and treatment that left me floating. All in all, if you're a beautiful person, or a beautifully wealthy person (better yet - both), you'll love this hotel. If you don't like the sound of paying $36 for two lattes, you're probably better off elsewhere.

VWe are regular visitors to NY and know how much of a difference a decent hotel makes. Hotel Giraffe was the perfect choice for our family. We stayed in a terrace suite that connected to a double/double for our 4 kids. 11th floor with great views. The hotel felt very intimate and upscale. Staff was very professional and helpful. Beds were super comfortable. Complimentary amenities such as bottled water are a rarity in NY. As is the complimentary breakfast and evening reception. The only slight drawback for some people may be the distance to main attractions such as Times Square. For those relcutant to walk that far, it is easy to catch the subway or a cab. Would definitely go back.

VTotally agree with all the reviews regarding location. We arrived into Newark Airport and took less than 30 minutes to get to the hotel on a Saturday night. We had prebooked a cab.\u000aCheckin was seamless and the rooms are very comfortable. We had a double and a twin with two doubles well i'mpretty sure they were Kings to be honest. Travel agent confirmed room only but we were told to eat as much as you want for breakfast. Good selection and if you ask to take away they will give you a bag etc. We would most definitely return.\u000aVery, very close to Times Square and Empire State is about S five minute walk. Lots of restaurants to choose from as well.\u000aWe did the Redline bus tour part of the Greyhound company. Best value out of all. We all did a helicopter ride around the Statue of Liberty oh and we shopped till we dropped.\u000aI can guarantee the hardest thing you will do is hail a cab!\u000aAny questions please ask.

VThis is a lovely hotel, a tranquil oasis in the middle of bustling, crazy Times Square. Often old hotels are in need of repair; this one is in mint condition, beautifully restored to its former glory.\u000aThe rooms are small (as most NYC rooms are) but elegantly furnished. There are no views of the exterior, windows are frosted and the thick walls keep traffic noise out, so the feeling of being in a secluded place -- in the middle of one of the world's most hectic locations -- is heightened. This is good for resting, but the room is too small to spend any extended time in. But who goes to NYC to spend time in a hotel room when the whole world is outside? The hotel lobby, lounge, and restaurant -- the location of the legendary Algonquin Round Table, the gathering place of Dorothy Parker and her literary friends -- are lovely places to hang out to check email with free wifi and a glass of wine, or dine. I like this hotel a lot. It gives you the best of both worlds - a pocket of serenity in the middle of Times Square. Great hotel.

VIf you want to stay near Times Square but not right in the middle of the flashing lights, this is a GREAT hotel. It's location is perfect but it's also tucked away just enough to avoid a lot of the commotion. The hotel itself is very nice, modern and the staff is great. If you're looking for a suite, the Simon & Schuster suite is excellent and you can add 2 connecting bedrooms for a 3-bedroom suite. The Blue Bar downstairs is excellent. Technically it is a Marriott property but there is very little about this hotel that feels like a Marriott (more of a boutique feel), but you earn reward points and get perks if you are an elite member. It's a excellent addition to the Marriott portfolio in Manhattan.

We were given a room with a magnificent view of the Empire State building which again is only a couple of blocks away . The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is very clean and quiet . If you like a lot of action and people around this is perhaps not the hotel for you , as it is quite a reserved atmosphere . The room was very well appointed and large and the beds were extremely comfortable. We had a our 12 year old grandson with us and this was not problem to anyone in the hotel the staff were all very nice to him . The concierge was informative and helpful and booked us tickets for the 9/11 memorial and for a show . All in all very good value and we would go back .

VI had stayed at this hotel in 2004 and my visit was pleasant at that time. So when I booked it again for a 3-night stay for 3 individuals I was surprised that the conditions were much worse. The condition of the room had deteriorated from my earlier visit in 2004. There was peeling wallpaper and the air vents did not look very clean and made a peculiar noise even when turned off. I could not find another hotel that had 3 rooms available in my price range so decided to stick it out. One of my traveling companions saw cockroaches on our last night there and the staff on duty just handed him a can of insecticide and said they would handle it the next day.

VI stayed at this hotel for the weekend with my two girls. The hotel was clean and neat, which is the only plus. If you are not Japanese, do not come here!!! The service was fairly good except for the fact that we are not Japanese and they were racist. The Japanese guests (99%), were a priority to them and the non-Japanese guests/us (1%) were not. The concierge was no good either we asked him for nearby breakfast options and he said there were none and that our best option was a Japanese buffet in the hotel. Sushi and dumplings do not sound appetizing at 9 AM. There is an abundance of hotels in NYC, my advice is to find another one. Hope this is helpful, I wish someone had written an honest review for me reference before booking here

VThis hotel is in its 'soft open'. Currently no food & beverage (except for the mini bar) and even the front sidewalk seems incomplete. But it is definitely a working hotel, and a decent one at that. I only wish I could say it was all good, but I did have some difficulties.\u000aThe first room I was given for my 4-night stay (1707...north-facing, which is to say not much of a view) was tiny. I guess I should say "normal," by NYC standards. And it would have sufficed, I suppose, but for two things: 1) there are no actual closets in the rooms. They have a sort of Ikea-looking piece of furniture that has drawers and a place to hang clothing, but the hanging area is limited and if you have a winter coat or anything wet to hang up, you are out of luck. It's an attractive, minimalist piece of furniture...just not entirely adequate. 2) The shower in room 1707 (and probably some others) is a rainfall shower. But it is not located on the shower ceiling...it is on the wall in front of you. That fact, plus the lack of great water pressure, means you shower under a sort of limp stream of water. The bathroom is beautiful and well appointed, but in my book a hotel room lives or dies by how good the shower is, and this was a fail.\u000aAlfredo at the front desk was very nice during my check-in and arranged to have me change rooms after my first night. It took some coordinating to actually do, but he and the rest of the staff were very helpful and for my final 3 nights I was in 1805 \u2013 a larger room with a much better view (looking due south past the Empire State Building) and a much better shower. Still with low water pressure, but at least this one was hand-held and thus much more effective.\u000aOh, and still no closet!\u000aSo, if you can find a nice rate (say, $250 or under) and can somehow get one of the south-facing rooms with a hand-held shower...I'd say go for it. Otherwise, I dunno...just not entirely worth it. No matter how friendly the staff may be \u2013 and they are.

VTo be short and sweet the only good thing was they changed the sheets and towels daily. I would go back as I now know what to expect but I wouldn't as I've seen cheaper on Trivago.\u000aTake EAR PLUGS as the air con is really noisy.\u000aThe long story. This was my birthday present from my partner, a Wowcher deal. My partner upgraded the room to a superior room!!\u000aWhen we arrived, I could not believe it was a superior room, they didn't even have drawers, where do you put your underwear?? I could of used our suitcase but why when we have paid for an upgrade, so we complained and got put into a room with drawers.\u000aThere was a plague saying the doors to the rooms are original from 1919, and they look it, really scruffy walls in our room and cat lick clean, the place is really tired.\u000aThe height of the shower is fine if your 4ft tall. tiny bathroom. no view as such, only looking onto the back of buildings, ok not everyone can get a decent view which is fair enough, but a lick of paint and a proper clean, and get rid of the dark brown carpets in the rooms.\u000aPeople don't really want to see a hotel from its original state since 1919, ok if its been cared for, it could look amazing if they really cared. they charge enough!! its a fantastic location, so why not make it that people would love to go back, the managers are really missing a trick here.\u000aThe owners of the hotel obviously aren't proud of their hotel, all they care about is money in their pockets, what a shame. Actually if the owners were more brighter, they would revamp their hotel and they would make a lot more money as people would be flooding back. but no they cant be bothered!!\u000aWhy do people go into this industry if they are not going to do it properly, I really don't understand. Wouldn't you want to be the best!!

VI have almost always had great experiences at Kimpton hotels, but I would never stay here again. I would say the worst part of the experience was that it seemed as the hotel staff felt they were doing us a favor by letting us stay there. Tried several times to go to the 16th floor bar for a drink and to check out the views. Each time I was told "closed for a private event". So welcoming. Then tried to have a drink and relax in the downstairs bar. Nothing says welcome like areas that are roped off from paying guests. Seriously? Gratuity automatically added for a party of 2? Even for NY this seemed obnoxious. At the bar and in the restaurant. Wouldn't have minded but the servers were AWFUL!!! They got me this time, but never ever again. Oh, and the room smelled of mildew. The bathroom was dark and dank. Yuck. Not impressed. I would rather pay a bit more and stay somewhere in a better location, with a better trained staff.

Staff were friendly and efficient. The location is very good and accessible to Tmes Square without being too close to the action.\u000aBut the rooms are TINY, even by New York standards. It seems the same care and money hasn't been invested in the rooms as has gone into the lobby and public areas of the hotel. The aircon in our room was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation while it was on. The standard room would be fine for a solo traveller, but two adults plus luggage made for a tight squeeze. Bathroom is similarly small.\u000aWould we stay again? Probably not, but it was a nice once-off stay.

VGreat little hotel with a great location.\u000aWe (a family of 4) stayed here for 3 nights. Our last hotel after 3½ weeks travelling around America.\u000aLocation wise it's great. We walked (up to Central Park), used the nearby Metro station and caught the bus so very easy to get anywhere.\u000aWe had a two bedroom family room which was lovely and large. However, to a flood the previous day we actually spent the first night in two separate rooms. Our double room was extremely small. The children shared a twin room which was much larger. I should add the hotel gave us a discount on this first night in compensation.\u000aBreakfast was a self service affair and was OK. There was plenty of food available. The only comment on breakfast was the awful room used. In addition to the pleasant lounge and library there is another room used for breakfast. In the cold light of day the room is awful. The chairs are mismatched and some stained. Also there isn't enough waiting staff to clear up each table between guests using the tables. Also it did get busy. However we felt the advantage of an inclusive good breakfast in the hotel (meaning we could get out earlier) outweighed the negatives.\u000aWe enjoyed the evening wine tasting on two evenings. On the first of these the service on the first evening was impeccable and the girl serving explained what wine was on offer and where it was from. She also offered us a second glass and gave us a plate of nibbles courtesy of the restaurant. We enjoyed it and we returned the second evening. This time the girl serving seemed uninterested in what she was doing and didn't offer the wines, I had to ask what was available. Also we weren't offered any nibbles although others were.\u000aUnfortunately the roof terrace wasn't available as I think it was being refurbished.

Rooms were nicely decorated and the suite was a good size, but bathroom was ridiculously small.\u000aHotel was understaffed at check out.

However, the sound proof was not very good in between rooms. I can hear slamming of doors and people talking next door to us.\u000aReceptions are very nice. However, not great in dealing with issues. There is definitely room for improvement for a 5 stars hotel.\u000aBreakfast was great. It was short of staff in the first few days. We waited for 10 minutes before a waiter came to ask us for coffee or tea. But slowly improving with a new manager in place during our stay.\u000aOverall, it's great hotel. 2 mins to subway entrance. 3 mins to Time Square (right in front of you) 5 mins to most theatres.

Speaking of excellence, during my stay there I was so fortunate to have my needs and expectations exceeded by Jessica at the front desk. She was so knowledgeable and kind-addressing questions throughout my stay-as well as recommending an incredible place to eat (the chirping chicken-oh so delicious btw).\u000aNew York is one of favorite places in part because of the consistent excellence in customer service I get at NYLO; if you're looking for a fantastic place to stay while visiting, I highly recommend NYLO.\u000aThank you also to Luis, who also provided outstanding customer service during my stay.

VWhen I lived in the NY area, I used to drive by the Hotel Giraffe all the time and said to myself, "that looks like an interesting place", so on a recent trip back to the City, I decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did. From the moment I checked in, I realized that I had found a gem. Small, personal, with great touches. The desk staff were fast and knowledgeable. I was so happy with my room -- when I saw the little balcony -- I thought, what a luxury. Besides all that, it was so clean, had a small refrigerator, and offered complimentary water. I ordered room service one night and it was both fast and delicious. I slept more soundly than many nights at home. I didn't really want to check out. But, I can't wait to go back.

VI travel to NYC regularly on business. I found the Hotel Giraffe on Tripadvisor while loking for a hotel near Bellevue Hospital on the lower East Side. It is an excellent hotel - quality, value, great locaton. Wine & cheese with live music 5-7 daily, free high quality continental breakfast, free WIFI, etc. A real winner!

VI visited this hotel with a friend for 7 nights for NYE - from 26th December 2016 to 2nd January 2017. Checking in was easy and simple. Staff were very friendly also..\u000aWe got to our room and I've never been so disappointed in a room in all my life (pictures attached) we got to the room and our beds felt like laying on bricks, the main room light also did not work, the switch just kept flicking. A lamp didn't work and we had to walk into our room with the torch light on on our phone. The phone was not plugged into the phone and was broken off so we couldn't even call down to reception initially. Also the walls and paint was cracking and dirty and the skirting boards were filthy.. into the bathroom and the metal around the lights that were framing the mirror was rusting off and there was exposed wires (in the bathroom!!), bath was yellow and things were falling off of it.. also curtains in the room did not draw open or closed. An awful start that actually drove my friend to tears with the awful flight that we experienced in that day also..\u000aWe proceed to go down to reception and ask for the manager and explain that the room is not fit to be in..\u000aThe man could not be more apologetic and proceeded to switch us rooms immediately which was better! King size bed and actually looked like the room had been cleaned! The skirting boards were still dirty but was a vast improvement..\u000aCleaners come into your room everyday and change everything and clean which was nice to come back to..\u000aFinal thoughts.. a room should never be sold in a state like it was but the room change and friendly staff made it better.\u000aProbably wouldn't stay again though.

VThis was a 3 night stay at the Four Points Chelsea in early April 2012. Our second visit to this hotel, having previously had a good experience and decided to return.\u000aCheck In\u000aArrived at the hotel around 2pm, greeted with a smile by the very pleasant check in clerk. A very quick check in process, as an SPG member the check in clerk looked to try and get me on a high floor.\u000aI was provided with a room key and a welcome cupcake (yum!) and headed to the elevator.\u000aReception\u000aIn the reception area there is a small seating area, a computer for guests to use and a bar/restaurant. I was advised that the restaurant is current under new ownership so was closed, but is opening again soon.\u000aThere are 2 elevators to head upstairs. We never had any issues with the elevators or delays, it takes a minute or so for the elevator to arrive but that is due to the high number of floors.\u000aRoom\u000aWe were allocated room 1804 on the 18th Floor. This is an SPG floor and I believe SPG floors are from 17-22.\u000aThe floors only have 8 rooms per floor.\u000aA large king bed, with a large plasma screen. The rooms are fairly small but not bad by NY standards.\u000aWe had a fantastic city view!\u000aThe beds at this hotel are AMAZING, very comfortable! The temperature control was easy with the air conditioner.\u000aFree high speed internet is offered in the room - this was very good and fast by normal Free Wifi standards.\u000aOverall\u000aAnother fantastic stay. The location is great, only 5 minutes walk to the 1 subway on 23rd street or you also have the F subway on 23rd st. The staff were pleasant and helpful as always.\u000aWe will definitely stay again!

VThe gothic exterior of this erstwhile seminary boarding house belies the slick and chic updating within.\u000aWe were greeted by the doorman who ushered us into a lobby that resembled a lounge for hipster extras waiting for their cue to take their places on a film set. Disorienting at first, until the incredible aroma of hand crafted coffee beverages hits you and you realize that the lobby doubles as a lounge for Intelligentsia Coffee, and these are local denizens enjoying the afternoon.\u000aJust before being sucked into the coffee scene, you're greeted by the "front desk", which is a small kiosk opposite the barista. That everything Daniel greeted us and proceeded to check us in and direct is to our rooms, while also assuring us that he would find us a table at one of the two hot spots in the neighborhood for dinner.\u000aWe ascended to our room and found it to be a toasty, cozy place, decorated with a loyalty to its origins but with a flat panel tv and new bathroom. The phone was a replica of a 1940s rotary model - who uses these anyway other than to dual zero?! As we settled in with our dogs - yes this is a pet friendly hotel - Daniel knocked to say we were all set for dinner. I half considered staying in though, popping the cork on the bottle of red wine and nibbling some of the snacks offered for purchase in the room, it was so inviting on a chilly night.\u000aYou can't beat the location of this spot. Between the High Line and lots of great eating places and galleries, there is no shortage of things to do on an weekend whim, a a short walk from the hotel. The coffee, by the way, is quite good. No syrups or trendy drinks here - this is the real deal, seriously prepared coffee, served by serious people that raise the foaming and decorating of milk in your latte to an art form.\u000aThis is a perfect place for an escape from suburbia, even for just a night. I still marvel at how Daniel could have been in so many places at once and serve as a one-man front desk and concierge, but he did so graciously and with enthusiasm.\u000a

VThe Jewel is a boutique hotel between 5th and 6th Avenues right across from Rockefeller Center, which puts you close to the theatre district, the 5th Avenue shopping scene, Central Park, and other historic sites. The hotel is small and rather informal; instead of a front desk, for instance, the staff greets you at the front door sitting on stools in front of computer monitors. The lobby is practically non-existent, but there's a second floor "living room" for hanging out in (free coffee available all day). Wi-fi is also free at the hotel, throughout the property, which I find a useful perk. The rooms are small, but the design uses the space very well, with a desk, chairs, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker all nestled in their places and lots of drawers and shelves for putting your things away in. I regretted that there was no in-room safe, which is always helpful in NYC. Nice bathroom. The design throughout the room is elegant and modern. I'll stay here again.

VWas not happy with this hotel. It is in a very busy part of NYC, in between horrendous Times Square and nasty Hells Kitchen area. The hotel loby could hardly be seen. The lighting is very low, giving the impression of a nightclub. If anyone has shopped in a Hollister store, they will understand the type of lighting I mean.  Our room was extremely basic. No form of any type of luxury whatsoever. Just a small double bed in a room with a small table and chairs. Infact the bed looked so small, i thought it was a single at first. There was no safe in our room for two out of the 3 nights we stayed, therefore we had to carry our passports, money and jewellery around New York. The air conditioning is old, noisy and was either freezing or too hot. It eventually stopped altogether and we had 1 1/2 nights without air conditioning, before eventually changing our room at 2.00 am (after we complained twice about the conditioning).  The bathroom looked tired with splits around the bath. The view from our room was of dirty roofs, workman and could hear dust carts all night. Times Square was soooo crowded and Hells Kitchen was dirty, had tacky restaurants and the streets were lined with tramps (hobos).  There was no "did you enjoy your stay" on check out, to which I would have replied absolutely not!  We really should have complained. Would only recommend this hotel for travellers going to the theatre who just are happy with a bed and no other luxury. This place lacks atmosphere and hospitality. A million miles from the 'chic and stylish' it calls itself. Only good thing to say is I found the bed reasonably comfortable.

VThe hotel is in a great location to Central Park, Broadway, and Times Square. The lobby is pretty small so there isn't really any room to congregate and hang out. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the street so it was pretty noisy at night. After all the walking, however, we slept through the noise. I would probably not stay here again because of the design of the bathroom. The door is designed so it does not close completely. It stops about 1 inch short of closing completely. Also, the shower is designed so that when you are taking a shower, the person in the room (if you are traveling with someone) can see clearly your silhouette as you shower. Privacy is a big thing for me so i would not stay at this location again. The staff however, were wonderful, very helpful and friendly. We were allowed to delay our check out since our flight didn't leave until the evening.

There was not one thing in the room that was not painted brown or made with brown material. The protestors were great to wake up to. Something needs to be settled with this.

I already knew this before arriving from reading previous reviews. I found this to be a very minor problem.

For the money this hotel is lovely, excellent location, good service, fab breakfast, we had a huge room with 2 double beds. We ate in the hotel on our last night as the snow was too deep to go out! We found the food, despite a rather select menu to be very good value and the service was great. We also went to the Marriot revolving bar and found the drinks to be very over priced and the service terrible. I would not advise anyone to go there.\u000a

VI stayed at this hotel with my husband and 2 teenage daughters between Xmas and New Year. Having read other reports about the location of this hotel I was a little hesitent about booking it but the views and the mordern feel made me book it.... it was a great move on my part. The walk from the hotel to Times Square is no more than 10 minutes and we walked in the daytime and at night. I never felt unsafe and the walk is a great trade off for the views as well as a way to walk off dinner.\u000aThe Hotel itself was very welcoming with great staff, larger than average room size for a city (in my experience) but I could of sat and looked at the skyline all night long.\u000aNo quibble with room service, breakfast, housekeeping etc as it all ran like clockwork and I would stay again with no reservations.\u000aTip...always try to book above the 7th floor as this has the best views!

On Monday when we had to leave for the airport the rain was pouring down...I found out that there are NO telephone #'s for taxi's but the desk person had a number for a SUV pickup..she called them for us And the gentleman was there in 10 min to pick us up...the cost was $90 but was glad to pay that to keep from ruining my luggage and getting on the plane soaking wet!!! Plus the ride was much more comfortable and less nerve racking than the taxi ride we took from the airport! There was a gorgeous view from the rooftop bar at night...I highly recommend this Fairfield Inn!!!

I love the hotel for it's "upscale, yet inviting feel" The bar service is good and has great entertainment. The beds are very comfortable and rooms well appointed. The king standard is too small for a roll-away and fine for short stays, but the King Deluxe is spacious enough to move around in with a larger bathroom. I have always found the front desk and service courteous and efficient. My only complaint is the WiFi. In room it is expensive and not as reliable as it could be. Overall, I love this hotel and will stay here again and again!

VWe fullfilled a long dream that I had, visit NYC for XMAS shopping and see all the famous places.\u000aWe decided to stay at the NYLO as they always have been a wonderful experience and wanted to be The Other Hotel Chain.\u000aThe drawbacks already started with the checking, first they told us the room was not ready, normally not a problem at all, so we decided to leave our luggage at the front desk. But instead of offering us to bring it to the room when this would be ready, they said, you have to pick it up later and bring it to your room. Well, not customer oriented but what should we do about it.\u000aWe decided to quickly go for the restrooms and than deliver our rental car back to the rental company. When we came back like 5 min later, they told us your room is ready. Really, you didn't know that 5 min earlier?\u000aWhen we arrive at the room, it was nice modernly equipted and and fine for the stay, the only problem was, that the WiFi was not working or they wanted 14 USD per day. First I booked my room with WiFi in the room and not only free in the lobby and secondly, hello we are in 2015 and every Motel manages it to offer free WiFi. I will continue and call out all the BAD Hotels above 4 stars that want to charge extra for something like WiFi, why?! Because we are your guests, we come on our holidays to your places and want to spend money during that time, we also send beautiful pictures and videos from our stay around the would, use social media, and basically making FREE advertisement form your businesses.\u000aAll that still doesn't justifies the 2 stars that I am given for that stay but 2 times not cleaning our room, bringen no towels is not exceptable and I don't need anybody to do my room at 9pm when I am back.\u000aAlso the lace is really noisy so you heard other guest,mleaving their rooms, talking, shutting their door etc.\u000aWill we stay again with NYLO in NYC, definatly NOT. Sorry about that and also the 2 free drinks for not doing our room twice ist not exceptable.

VI stayed in this hotel for four nights in July 16.\u000aThe hotel is handily placed just a stones throw from the 79th Street Subway station. 79th is on the A line which is easy to use and serves most of the main tourist destinations.\u000aThe hotel reception was welcoming and efficient, we were offered a free glass of wine on arrival, this was served from a table in reception.\u000aThe restaurant was adjacent to the hotel reception, there is a connecting door to access it directly at breakfast time but at other times of the day the restaurant had to be accessed via the street.\u000aThe rooms were a reasonable size, there is a safe and an iron/ironing board. The beds were large and comfortable. The bathroom again was a reasonable size, not huge but just about comfortable, the hair dryer in the bathroom was not particularly efficient.\u000aSo why did I score this hotel average? Well outside of the room the facilities are pretty basic, the room itself has no fridge but a small bottle of still water sat on top of the desk with a $6.75 price tag draped proudly round it's neck. This is a good hotel to sleep in but be prepared to head out and about for a decent choice of food, drink and entertainment.

VI travelled to New York with my mum for my 21st birthday.\u000aThe staff are very friendly. Upon arrival we were earlier than the recommended check-in time but were given a room straight away.\u000aThe rooms are a good size, we had a double bed each, they are modern and clean. The bathroom door was a slidey door which didn't seem to lock, which was slightly unusual, but is very nice otherwise.\u000aThe safe is free to use. And the only thing missing I would say is a small fridge in the room, which would of been nice to store water.\u000aThe breakfast is relatively simple but still a good choice on the buffet (and when you consider all the big lunches & dinners you'll have in NYC it's perfect), however you do have to eat using plastic cutlery & paper plates. I did really enjoy the breakfast that was offered!\u000aOverall our stay at the Holiday Inn Herald Square was very nice, and I'm certain we will be back :)

VI love boutique hotels and I was not disappointed by this place. It has a great feel to it and is in a nice, quiet (by NYC standards) neighborhood. However, what really made this hotel stand apart was its excellent customer service. We showed up before check-in and they were able to find us a room early! (a blessing for weary travelers) However, our room had a distinctly mildew odor that we could not easily endure for our whole stay. Upon informing the front desk, they immediately went to work solving the problem and finding us a new room. They even upgraded our room due to the inconvenience! (three cheers to Chris at the front desk for taking care of us!)\u000aA note to the critical reviewers: Is it expensive? Yes. Are the rooms small? Yes. Is there traffic noise? Yes. C'mon people: IT IS NEW YORK CITY! Compared to the other hotels in the city, this hotel gives great value to its guests and has stellar customer service. My husband and I will happily stay here in the future!

The room is considered to be mine until 11:00 AM and if it was houskeeping they should not have tried to enter the room. I spoke to the front desk and received no satisfaction. The room was clean and recently renovated. I wouldn't recommend this hotel -- privacy and safety is very important to me.

VThe rooms were too noisy. Bathrooms were too small. Overall it was not worth the price. If your room included breakfast, you'll be given a voucher to use at a restaurant outside the hotel (a five minutes walk and not a suitable place for a family) even though there is one within the hotel.\u000aIn this price range you can have much better hotels to stay at.

VThere are few (if any) good cheap hotels in NYC. It is worth (in my opinion) paying a little more to have an oasis of calm at the end of a busy day. This is what ICTS provided.\u000aThe room was spacious and modern - with everything that one needs. We went for a Skyview room and there was no traffic noise at all - again a big plus after a busy day.\u000aOnly gripes a usual things re (no) free wifi and expensive water. Again not a big surprise - just be prepared.\u000aStaff were really friendly and helpful.

VFor my birthday, my wife booked me a trip to NYC. We have stayed in Intercontinental before in Fiji and it was great. This location was perfect for us. Next to the Subway. One block from Times Square. Restaurants everywhere but still fairly quiet at night (with ear plugs). Service was good/great although didn't need to utilize it for anything major. We did Not use the concierge really because we tend to be pretty independent. The ice machine never worked on our floor. We had to ask for extra TP a couple of times (they didn't refill it upon cleaning) although they brought it up quickly when we were low. View was excellent. Could see the Majestic, 8th Avenue, the Westin and see the traffic!! Which is New York right? To and from JFK was effortless. Took a suburban for two of us back for flat rate 75$. Took about 45 minutes on a Saturday noon time drive.\u000aOverall very pleasant and perfect birthday trip. One last funny thing is that if you move the food/drinks on the table and if not replaced within 30 seconds they have a sensor that charges you. Our water was knocked over and I didn't realize. At checkout they took the charge off quickly without hassle.\u000aThanks Intercontinental.

Plus, the staff was ever so helpful in helping me connect to the internet, providing extra coffee, helping me print documents, etc. When I checked in, they did ask if I would mind a small bathroom. I said I didn't mind. The bathroom was very, very small, but it was updated and very clean. On the other hand, my room was very spacious.

We loved many things about this fairly new IHG hotel and will definitely be back.\u000aThe location just off Times Square at 44th and 8th was central for everything we did throughout NYC via easily accessible taxis and the subway to more local haunts, or just walking around Times Square and midtown NYC.\u000aWe were upgraded to a beautiful corner room with a wide open unobstructed view through large windows across midtown west NYC to the Hudson River. We loved the king bed mattress and pillows. We loved the bathroom rainfall shower. And we really appreciated the warm, friendly, helpful staff, especially Darlene Demorizi at the front desk. Thanks Darlene !\u000aWe didn\u2019t eat at the Todd English restaurant, but spent some time at the bar for drinks one afternoon. Net, a very enjoyable stay. We will be back again for sure.

Great lobby for hanging out in, some of the kids took advantage of the exercise room and was easily accessible to Times Square. The rooms were small and so were the bathrooms but we were able to make it work. We paid additional to have security on our floor so that the chaperones could get some sleep and they suggested a company. The only issue we had was with the voucher system for the Cafe. They ran out of bagels. They were easy to work with and exceptionally accommodating. I would stay there with a group again.

VWe selected this hotel to be close to the tree lighting at Rockefeller Center (which was the reason for our NYC trip) and ended up having a wonderful stay! The location couldn't be better. From our window we could see Radio City Music Hall to the right and St. Patrick Cathedral to the left. Although we couldn't actually see the tree from our window, the sidewalk leading to it was just right out the front door of the hotel.\u000aBill's Burgers just across the street has wonderful food and is open late. There is a full service pharmacy/drugstore (Walgreens inside, but a different name on the facade) just a few doors down.\u000aFrom there we were able to easily visit MoMA which is only two blocks away. We were in walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, and the Theater District - no more than about a 10-15 min walk.\u000aOur room was perfect for what we needed. Room 709. Clean and fresh. We had a room with a kitchenette which included a microwave and small fridge as well as a coffee maker. The room was small but well designed and so it didn't feel cramped at all. We always carry a small portable sound machine for sleep and with that, we never were awakened by any street noise. The hotel also has sound machines to borrow if you don't normally carry one. The free wifi and the free bottled water stations were a great find! The ironing boards and irons are kept in a closet in the hallway by the bottled water station on each floor. They were always available and in great condition. I liked the fact that you had to use your room key for the elevator to allow you to get to your floor.\u000aCheck in and Check out ladies were friendly. Had room service our first night since we got in late and didn't know yet what was around. They were timely and the food was good. Reasonably priced. The staff was helpful with activity suggestions and directions. They have discounts on various attractions that are nearby (we used the Top of the Rock discount card for $2 off each admission). They also have options for early check in and late check out options for an additional fee.\u000aWe had a wonderful stay at this hotel for our first NYC trip and will definitely be back.

VI should start by saying I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels for their eclectic and inspired interior design, service ethic and attention to thoughtful details, like having lobby coffee service available early in the morning. I reserved a City View Studio King Room for my husband's birthday. The room had a comfortable lounging sofa and chair, and I knew the large soaking tub would be welcome after a lot of walking. While we had a few agenda items in mind for the weekend, relaxation was high on the list and our room fit the bill for that purpose. The concierge/front desk staff sent a lovely bottle of red wine to our room in honor of my husband's birthday, a really nice touch.\u000aI was wary about the Hell's Kitchen location, as it is a bit far from the subway; that might be a deterrent on other occasions, depending on my schedule. Our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, so we opted for lunch at the Gotham West Market, 2 short blocks away. Our lunch at El Colmado reminded us of eating tapas at La Boqueria in Barcelona, and another nearby stellar option for breakfast pastries and coffee, or a snack anytime, is Sullivan's Bakery, less than a block away on West 47th St.\u000aI would definitely stay here again.

VWe just returned from a four night stay at this hotel. Our hotel of choice had been The Alex, however, we could not get a one bedroom suite this trip, so after carefully reviewing tripadvisor we chose Hotel Giraffe. Upon arrival we immediately felt we had made a wise choice and never changed our minds throughout our stay. The location of the hotel is perfect with a subway station across the street. The rooms were perfectly cleaned. Breakfast each morning and the evening receptions were a special treat since were traveling with a 5 year old . The hotel is very kid friendly, we never felt out of place with our little one. The staff was delightful and very helpful, especially the young ladies serving breakfast and the wine and cheese. We had a wonderful stay and we do plan on staying again.

VOk, so this is NYC and one can expect tiny rooms and no view. No big deal either that there is no elevators and that the reception is on the first floor ... BUT this hotel deserves a serious makeover and some TLC . The carpets are worn out, the table lamps are so old they hardly stand when you switch them on and off, the bathrooms are falling apart , old saris are not curtains and a chair or a small wardrobe is not a luxury !\u000aThe staff is young and friendly and they do their best to make up for the rest, and the location is really excellent. It is time to give this hotel a refreshing lick of paint, change the. carpets and refurbish. It would take little investment to make this place great and I hope that the owner does it quickly before it becomes too late... It is such a shame that things are left to rot this way. I would love to "love" this hotel but it really is not acceptable at this point. I had to change the room three times to find a good enough room, even then it was just about ok. Can do better and hope it does. It could be nice but at this moment avoid it if you can .

The subway station is at the end of the street and there are other subway stops within walking distance. The subway is an excellent way to get around once you negotiate the system and the ticketing system. The breakfast at the hotel was lovely (rare to find hotels that provide breakfast in Manhattan). The view of Empire State Building from the roof is amazing! The staff were helpful. Our room was at the back of the hotel so no noise. The bed was very very comfortable and the room was quite big by New York standards. Would stay there again and again.

VFirst off, this hotel is located in a great location. Right next door to a shake shack, and right next to the A,C,E subway entrance, you cannot beat that on a cold winter day in NYC. I booked a deluxe room, and they upgraded my room to a sky view room which was very nice. I don't have any complaints about the staff or the actual rooms themselves, all were pretty good. The problem is that a lot of little things added up that made this stay just average. Here are the list of little things,\u000a1) While checking in at the front desk i was given a choice between 1000 bonus points or 30 dollars in mini-bar credit. I chose mini-bar credit, but when I got into my room, the spire ambassador welcome letter stated that i can choose between 1,000 bonus points or 20 dollars. I had to call the front desk to confirm it is indeed 30 dollars.\u000a2) with the confirmed 30 dollars in mini-bar credit, we were excited to raid the mini-bar. But the mini-bar door wont open.......had to call the operator again, and they had to send an engineer to the room to fix the mini-bar refrigerator door.\u000a3) coming back from an early morning run, my room key stopped working for the elevator. Had to go to the front desk to get the room key re-assigned.\u000a4) second night, i could not sign onto wifi for more than 30 minutes. Finally decided to call the operator again. She had to transfer me to a technician. The technician had to reset something, didnt say what, but wifi worked after that.\u000a5) third day coming back room keys stopped working again. had to go to the front desk to get the room key re-assigned again.\u000a6) upon checking out, they forget to credit me the mini-bar.............inexcusable really. They also did not credit me the free Ambassador weekend night. It was a good thing the person checking me out was the same person checking me in. So he remembered that he had taken my certificate upon check-in. He apologized which was good, but it was definately a good thing that i took a look at the bill during check-out.\u000aOverall these little things added up to just an average experience. Despite all of these little things, I think i would actually go back because of its great location, and very comfortable rooms.

VSubway at the end of the street, safe in room, umbrella, coffee maker, good AC, higher-end decor, restaurant adjacent, friendly and helpful staff, CLEAN, lots of towels, will hold luggage after check-out, comfortable-sized double double room. 2 beds, larger nightstand, phone, alarm/radio, desk, office chair, bureau, wall-mounted TV. Average per night was $260 (taxes and all) for 4 and we weren't offered any upgrades. Did get a 15% off coupon for breakfast in the restaurant, but, didn't want to waste time sitting for that, so, we didn't use it. Stayed on top floor, but, had hallway/stair door noise. Room door almost seems open when you approach it, so, make sure to pull it shut, so it locks. For some reason, kept getting 3 washcloths for a room booked for 4 and didn't get any more when I asked at the desk, though they said they'd send them up. Got a few more the one day I left a note for housekeeping, then, back to 3, though I tipped every day. No continental breakfast, or, coffee in the lobby, even. Try THE AMSTERDAM GOURMET on the corner across the street--just the thing. Wish they would have promoted that so I would have known earlier in my trip. No mirror near a plug outside the bath, so, getting ready, or even into the bath, is more time consuming than necessary. Blackout curtains were short. Had to go outside in the rain to access the restaurant, though the door through the hotel was open earlier (when there was no rain). Clean is my number one priority and it was spotless and the location couldn't be more convenient. Any minor inconveniences noted were just thoroughness on my part.

VI can't think of a worse customer service experience than what I encountered during a recent stay at NYLO.\u000aI first stayed here in late 2012 when it was still On the Ave. and had a wonderful time. If you did, too, please don't arrive at NYLO expecting the same experience that the former hotel offered. Everything has been redone, from the hideous new lounge furniture to the now-broken elevators to the ugly stainless-steel bathroom sinks.\u000aWhen we arrived at NYLO last week, we were told that although we had reserved a room with a king-size bed, the only one available was on the second floor, directly over the lounge, and very noisy. At this point, just about any hotel would have offered us a nicer room with a king bed in it. Not NYLO! They gave us a tiny queen room and said we could pack up all our stuff the next morning to get into a room that we had originally reserved.\u000aIn addition to the bed difference, the queen room they put us in was mess. It looked like it had barely been cleaned and was missing several basics, including toilet paper! Through all of this, the woman at the front desk -- whose name we'll never know, since none of the employees wear name tags -- was horribly unhelpful. Truly, customer service at its worst.\u000aOther low points: 2 out of the 4 elevators work, and with 15 floors to serve -- including countless employees riding up or down on one-floor trips -- it can take forever to get to and from your room. I saw the same complaint in a review many months ago and assumed it would be fixed by the time we stayed there. Nope! The check-in and check-out lines are also absurdly long, probably due to the awful customer service.\u000aNot the worst hotel in NYC, certainly, but just be aware before you book!

We picked this hotel because of the reviews we read on tripadvisor and they were so helpful!! we had a financial situation when we got there and the staff were so helpful and worked it out for us. They even upgraded us for free to a king room that was huge! As soon as you walked in it smelled clean and tastefully decorated. We didnt have a noise problem and slept great though you could hear some street noises in the morning...but hey, its NYC!! The location was great, we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go and the luggage storage the hotel provided was great and so helpful! the breakfast was great for something quick and light and a good way to start the day. we didnt get down until it almost ended and everything was still fresh and available. we would definitely stay here again!\u000a

Strange drapes - hard to open and close if you aren't tall. The coffee from room service was terrific! And can't beat the location if you're going to Broadway shows - right down the street. Subway within 1 block, huge staircase up when coming back, but does have escalator, thank god. Personally, I prefer a studio hotel with microwave - cheaper to keep breakfast and leftovers than to have to go out or use room service. But for a plain hotel, this is fine.

This time, my room is smaller but quite sufficient for one person, and it features a coffeemaker, safe, iron and ironing board and a nice big flat screen tv (with very basic channels). The bathroom is fine too though i would prefer a full size tub and more room around the toilet (it is too close to the wall). I am staying on the fifth floor of 12 and am not bothered by street noise in the least. What's even better is the free unlimited Inet access and domestic USA calls. The staff was also very attentive when i had problems with the phone and fixed them in a timely fashion, and the cleaning staff is inobtrusive but very helpful if extra towels or whatever is needed. The free continental breakfast is also great; enough to keep me going til dinner. As to the neighborhood, it feels very safe and is very convenient to buses and subways yet sedate -- and i love that. I also have found the front desk clerks just fine to deal with. The hotel meets my needs perfectly -- what more can i say?!

The rooms are decorated with antiques and cool floral wallpaper with really comfortable beds and great service. They have Intellegentsia coffee downstairs and has a very neighborhood feel.

VI took a a group of 26 Executive MBA students to NYC and we stayed at Hotel Chandler. We were all very happy to have stayed there. The staff has been very helpful,friendly and professional at the same time. The location is also great. I would definitely stay there again if I go back to NYC, whether on a business trip or for leisure. The only thing that I would like to propose for an improvement is the air conditioning which is a little bit noisy.

We couldn't have asked for anything more from the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to the free breakfast to its convenient midtown location. The rooms are large (by any big city standard) and plush and ours even had a balcony. The reviews for this hotel are not exaggerated, it's a gem in New York.

VOne of TA's faults is that there is no intermediary rating between "fair" and "very good". The Lucerne is a solid "good" but to rate it "fair" would be, well, unfair. If VG is a bit high, so be it. We enjoyed our recent stay and, if you know what you're getting into, this is a great neighborhood spot perhaps best for non-first time NYC visitors. The upper west side location is not that convenient to the major tourist spots (though the subway line is just a block away) aside from the Museum of Natural History (a short walk) or the Met (a 15-20 minute walk across Central Park). For my wife and I -- who have visited NYC many times -- staying in the upper west side was intentional. We wanted to be near the park and in a non-touristy locale. Everything around the Lucerne serves the local population -- bars, restaurants, playgrounds, markets and services -- and you won't find a lot of tourists wandering about. We liked the scene. As for the hotel, we had a corner king room ("king" being a bit of an oxymoron at almost any NY hotel) on an upper floor with 2 windows. If you peered closely one window gave us a glimpse of the Hudson, the other a long shot up Amsterdam Ave. Maybe not views of the Chrysler Building, but better than a brick wall. The room was decently sized and appointed, clean, a bit old fashioned, but the Lucerne has a fading elegance about it. Don't expect chic or contemporary, go with the flow, and you'll be fine. We did little but sleep in the room anyway, though I imagine if you want to kick back and luxuriate in your hotel room, this may not be the spot.One flaw: Lack of places to plug in all the electronics people travel with these days. For the price we paid (about $200 a night) in NYC, this was a "very good" spot. They even throw in a free NY Times delivered to your door. No problems with noise aside from AC (as others have noted). We had breakfast in the adjoining (and quite attractive) restaurant and it was fine but you'll pay for it. We could just have easily grabbed a less expensive coffee and muffin at any of a number of places nearby. Incidentally, we went to the theater one night in Times Square and the cab fare was less than $12 so if you don't want to take the subway at night, the cab ride is eminently doable.

VMy advice - do not stay at the Ramada Inn - it is awful. We arrived at the Ramada Inn in early June 2014, expecting to stay for five nights. On arrival we found reception to be a temporary desk as there is building work going on at the moment. Reception staff were unhelpful. There was an additional tax charge made per night, which could not be explained to us. We then went to our room in a small lift that moves very slowly. The corridor outside the room was not very clean. The bedroom itself was very small with little room for storage. It had a damp musty smell and the carpet was not clean. The bed sheets looked like someone had already slept in the bed. We asked at reception if it would be possible to move room, but the receptionist was unhelpful with poor English and told us all rooms are the same.\u000aNext morning we went for breakfast - in the basement amongst the storage rooms. Cheap tables & chairs covered with bed sheets as tablecloths & plastic/disposable cups, plates, cutlery. The small breakfast room was full, so we were directed across the hall to another room to sit & eat. A few tables against the wall in another small room, tables again covered with bed sheets. We then realised we were actually in the business centre room!!\u000aWe contacted our tour operator and promptly moved to the Row Hotel where we had a completely opposite experience - it was fantastic.\u000aThe Ramada Inn was awful

Our reservation was for two rooms, one for our daughter and son in law and a two bedroom suite for my husband, myself and daughter. Iris at the front desk was personable, helpful, professional, knowledgeable and so accommodating. We had breakfast buffet at the Club Quarter on the 7th floor which gave us a gorgeous view while eating outside. Mariam suggested we have lunch at the sister property at Ground Zero at the View of the World restaurant. It provided a breathtaking view of 911 Memorial along with a fabulous menu.\u000aThe Jewel was extremely spacious with kitchenette, living area and private bedroom. It was equipped with everything you would need for an extended stay. We were so pleased with the chilled, purified water stations on each floor and was so necessary in the hot weather. Our rooms were quiet and comfortable. ( rooms 1001 and 707).\u000aThe location cannot be better as it was across from Rockefeller Center, within a few city blocks to Times Square, amazing restaurants, shopping, 5th Ave, MoMA, NYC library, Central Park, Radio City Hall, NBC, etc etc.\u000aI would highly recommend the Jewel and will definitely be staying here when we return.

It is so central that I would definitely stay there again and spend the money elsewhere on food and drink. There was wifi you could buy which was cheap enough.

The hotel is partly condos on some floors, so it was interesting to mingle with the locals on the way in/out. The hotel room has and old feel to it. We didn't see any of the creepy-crawlies that some travelers have complained about. We only used our hotel as a base to facilitate scheduled auditions for our kids in NYC. It was well worth the $109, as we were hardly ever in the room; but, I was happy with the general cleanliness of the room for bathing and sleeping. I would give the hotel another chance if I could get the same nightly rate. Hotel is within great walking distance of Broadway other major streets/aves. Great pizza/shopping just blocks away.

VThe Lucerne occupies an unusual position somewhere between full service luxury hotel and limited service furnished apartment.\u000aThere is no dedicated hotel bar, lounge, or restaurant. Of course, being New York, there are limitless food and drink options right outside the door, but we enjoy room service breakfast. Room service is handled by the adjoining Nice-Matin, a French bistro-style cafe. This proved to be a less-than-ideal arrangement as our room service orders were delivered incorrectly or incomplete each time.\u000aThe fitness room and gym are small but appropriately furnished.\u000aIf you can afford it, spring for one of the deluxe suites. Aside from the postage stamp-sized bathroom, our suite was quite spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed. The decor was a little drab, but to each his own. There is no central HVAC. Instead, heating and air conditioning are controlled by difficult-to-regulate window units similar to those you would find at a budget motel.\u000aThe Lucerne is one of the few options on the UWS, and is one of the best. The location is great, very safe, adjacent to a busy subway stop and steps away from the American Museum of Natural History and Central Park. Depending on the time of year, it can be a good value (although the entire New York hotel market has become outrageously expensive year round). That said, many tourists, especially first timers, would probably prefer a Midtown hotel, closer to more shopping and tourist attractions.\u000aStaff were somewhat frosty and made no real attempt at personal service. Not exactly rude, but some seemed to be "going through the motions."\u000aOverall, your opinion of The Lucerne will depend on your expectations. If you like the full array of traditional hotel services or the feeling of being "in the thick of things," The Lucerne might be disappointing. Otherwise, it's a solid choice.

Unfortunately, the negative reviews are right: this is a rather depressing place. The carpets are dirty and reek of smoke, the wall paper is stained and peeling down, and the plumbing seems to be in want of repair: In the adjacent room, the toilet was flushing every two minutes and then shutting down with a lout thud. Also, the mattress had a deep gap and the sheets were too small to cover them fully. The only good thing about this hotel is the location on the UWS.

And the drink prices don't take the p%ss!\u000aGreat location for exploring downtown will be even better when all the roadworks are over.\u000aOverall couldn't have had a better weekend in NY.

VWe split our trip to NYC between two hotels and NYLO was the second hotel, following a great experience in Tribeca. The staff couldn't have been nicer - not simply polite and professional - but warm. They anticipated our needs, offered services we hadn't contemplated, and made our stay significantly better than it would otherwise have been. We will certainly recommend NYLO for both personal and business trips.

VSuperb service throughout our stay and the staff really do go that extra mile. It was a special occasion and communication with the staff prior to the visit was faultless as was our time there. I proposed to my girlfriend and the hotel were in on the surprise doing everythign I asked ot make it a one off special occaison. The key thing with the hotel and their approach is whislt professional not overly so which is a nice balance if you ask me. Location safe a superb and a short 2 min walk to the subway. Rooms are very good however im not sure of the smaller ones and can only speak for the 14th floor room with sit out. My only issue is that although refurbished certain areas appear to be over looked, light switches and bathrooms all a little tired, smacks of a cheaper renovation in my opinion however the bed was incredible. One more tip and I have let the hotel know is the age old gripe of no mirror above the desk where the hair dryer is, this is my Fiances biggest issue with any hotel and sadly NYLO is missing htis too.\u000aOverall a great place to stay, rates very reasonable for NYC. Anyone complaining of room size need to have a reality check, its NYC!! Deals a plenty and my top tip would be contact reservations directly, you may be surprised if you ask nicely

VWe booked for a four night stay at the Hotel Metro in November 2008 through Thomson Signature. The hotel had been recommended to us by some friends who had previously stayed there. We had originally booked for a deluxe double but the room we had been allocated, although perfectly roomy and clean, smelled of smoke. George on Reception was our hero and very kindly upgraded us to a Family Suite! One bedroom window had a view of the Empire State Building and the other bedroom window had a view of Macys! What more could we ask for?! The room was spotlessly clean with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Coffee and tea were available 24 hours a day downstairs and the breakfast was fantastic - bagels over here are not a patch on the real thing!\u000aLocation-wise, you couldn't get much better if you tried. 1 block from the Empire State Building, a block from Macy's, 5th Avenue and all its shops are right on your doorstep.\u000aThe Reception staff that we had contact with were all extremely helpful, gave advice and suggestions on where to go, what to see and the best/cheapest way of doing it. Again, a big shout out to George!\u000aThere is a small gym on the top floor of the hotel, next to the roof terrace. I did go with the best intentions but never got round to using it - pounding the streets of New York was exercise enough!\u000aAll in all, it was a fantastic and we are planning our return trip for next year to the same hotel.

VI switched hotels from the Crowne Plaza JFK to The Jewel due to location for my wedding. The staff was great and very helpful whenever we needed anything (ear buds, towels, etc). The room is small, our TV did not work (it did not have sound), there were about 15-20 fruit flies in our shower (I took the time to count them as I was drowning them), the bed is actually two twin beds pushed together so there is a very uncomfortable line down the middle for couples, there is no fridge, and it's incredibly loud outside at night. Since it was so close to the Rockefeller Center, it's understandable. My room at the Crowne Plaza was much nicer, but way too far away from the city. I don't quite understand why this hotel is rated so highly other than the convenient location.

VWe recently stayed at LeSoleil for three nights and I feel like it was truly a find - a tremendous hotel with heart right in the "heart" of the city. I was looking for a luxury hotel (4+ stars) that could accomodate 4 of us (2 couples) in a larger room, and be somewhat affordable (by NYC standards). We stayed in a very generous sized room, with a queen bedroom on one side and the sleeper sofa in the main area of the suite, with the luxurious bathroom in-between.\u000aThe hotel earned its 4 stars in the usual ways (gracious lobby, attention to detail, furnishings) - however it really set itself apart by their treatment of their guests. I mentioned that it was my sister's birthday during our stay, so they noted this on the reservation. I was overjoyed when the crew at reception broke into a chorus of "Happy Birthday" on our second night there. Upon getting home, I realized that I might have left behind some clothing at the hotel. They had the items - and were very helpful in shipping them back to me. This hotel is truly a find, and has such nice people working there. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and plan to go back next time I need a hotel in NYC.

I'll give them benefit of the doubt for still being rather new. I would stay here over Times Square any day.\u000aWifi consistency could be improved -- found it slow at times.\u000aAfter feeling like getting snowed checking in about getting such a nice room and upgrade, my room was right across from the elevator for a 4-night stay. lame but I was too tired to request another.\u000aThe room itself is clean, roomy enough for NY, bed is average, shower is lovely with enough pressure.\u000aI found service when calling the front desk for things very prompt, polite, friendly and timely.\u000aBreakfast at the Fourth is average -- the service seemed bored and my sunny side up eggs came to me over medium.

VI have to hand it to the St. Mark's Hotel, on two levels.\u000aFirst off, if you are looking for an inexpensive, serviceable place to overnight it in NYC, you can't do much better for your buck than this. I stayed at the Hotel for a week, stuck between the dorm I was leaving, and the shared apartment I was moving into. The staff was cool with the boxes I had to bring with me temporarily, the room was clean, and, despite the frequent circulation of transient boarders, I never felt unsafe during my stay. Oh, and the bathroom was SPOTLESS. If anything, I spent a week in one of the most interesting parts of town, and then, at only $80 a night. Best of all? They took me in without a problem, after nearly every other place in town turned me down via phone.\u000aAs far as the other level goes, I'll just say it. Yeah, I have been one of those transient boarders that rents the Hotel's rooms by the hour. Basically, when you're in a hidden relationship, with no other place to go... yeah, you remember places like this one. And I'll say it - the staff is cool with it, hires out by the hour, and gives you a clean, spartan room for the purposes you have in mind. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job well. They even knock on the door to let you know when your time is up - thoughtful, huh?\u000aSo, for whatever rooming purposes you have in mind, the St. Mark's Hotel has a room for you. The price is right, the place is clean, and no questions are asked. What more can you ask for?\u000a

VI was here as the leader of a group of 23 during our H.S. Spring Break Choir trip. I was pleased with the size of the rooms compared to others we have had in NYC. Some of us had tubs and some had shower stalls. Rooms seemed to all have slight differences. But, all in all, my bathroom and linens were clean. But, yes, the bathroom was tiny, for sure. The first part of our week the weather was temperate, so we immediately asked for the heat to be turned off. Someone came to my room to take the cover off the window a/c unit for me to use. He also showed me how to open the windows. I had a room on the 10th floor. I was pleased that except for one afternoon when the hotel was full of basketball fans and alumni, it was easy to get an elevator. There were several elevators. Elevators have been a huge issue during other spring break trips. (breaking down, only one or two, scary) The location is amazing for Penn Station or Madison Square Garden. We did not mind the walk to the Times Square Area. Also, it was not a scary area to have students out exploring in twos. I also had to call someone to turn the heat back on when the weather changed. My room did not work with the thermostat. The service person was very kind and accommodating. The staff at the desk were also very helpful when we were not all able to check in at first. They helped us store our luggage until the rooms were ready. After I returned to Texas, I realized that a part of my iphone charger was left in the electri plug near the bedside table. The Housekeeping Manager, Shaka A. Saul, retrieved it for me and mailed it to my home, which was much appreciated.

Facilities and amenities are very well maintained at this boutique somewhat upscale facility. If you wish luxurious facilities you may need to look elsewhere but the service and facilities here can match some of perks of the luxurious hotels. Centrally located, you have easy access to anything from Central Park to Times Square and Broadway without the vastness and noise of the large scale hotels. Anything on Manhattan is within easy reach since it is located within one block of several subway stops.

VSet between 5th Avenue and Broadway/6th Ave with the Empire State Building a block away, Macy's on the end of the street and a subway station on the corner, you couldn't ask for much more from a central New York Hotel! The rooftop bar was an excellent bonus, with views directly to the ESB - breathtaking! Especially welcome during the hot weather we experienced during our trip. The free continental breakfast was a great feature, although the area did become quite busy. We stayed in a standard double, which was perfectly adequate for our needs, spacious enough with a built in wardrobe, flat screen TV and i pod dock clock radio, with a large comfortable bed. The hotel was clean and well kept, and all staff welcoming and friendly. The attached restaurant/bar is also worth a visit for lunch/dinner. We were in a room at the front of the hotel, and there was a lot of street noise from traffic and roadworks etc, but nothing a pair of earplugs didn't sort out - after all, you are in central New York City, not a quiet retreat!

The reception service, portering and the concierge were all excellent and helpful. Location was perfect for travelling by train and easy to get on subway to all attractions. Yes the first stay we had been given a smaller room but the beds were lovely and comfortable. Rooms were clean and ear plugs are provided in all rooms if needed. Obviously, being in the city centre there was some slight noise. however this could be easily remedied with the ear plugs if necessary. But having been out all day,we had no problems with our sleeping!. The receptionist remembered our anniversary and we had a bottle of wine sent to our room. Made it special.\u000aThanks for a lovely welcome and stay

VI got a room at the last minute on Hotel Tonight at the Fairfield Inn by Marriott Midtown/Penn Station. I knew of the hotel just from walking past it on my way to Penn Station at the end of a different recent trip to NYC, and when I saw the rate pop up on the website I jumped on it.\u000aComing up out of the 8th Ave. / 33rd St. exit of Penn Station and only having to walk a half block to the hotel is FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC when you've been on a train all day, and that train is late.\u000aThe room was very clean, and a good size by NYC standards. I liked the fact that there were ample plugs within easy reach for my phone, etc. The room smelled good, and it was really quiet for being on a fairly small hallway. I didn't hear anyone all night. I also liked the exhaust fan in the bathroom; there's nothing worse than taking a shower and being enveloped in a steam bath that smells like old hotel. The property is really new, and I like that as well.\u000aThe breakfast was good for a moderately priced hotel breakfast (not fancy by any stretch, but it had a lot more options than most hotels at that price point in the city.) The hot options were sufficient and there was ample seating in the dining area.\u000aI was concerned about my super-late check-in (midnight) but since I purchased the room through Hotel Tonight, they intervened on my behalf and called the hotel twice to make sure that my room would be saved, even though I was arriving so late. Check in was smooth and easy, as was checkout. The front desk staff was very friendly for such a busy, crazy city.\u000aThe rooftop patio was really nice. I love having an outdoor space at a hotel in which to decompress and take in the city or countryside. The patio was perfect for that, with plenty of comfy sofas. I didn't partake of any beverages out there since it was shutting down, but it felt good to sit and watch the lights at the top of the Empire State Building, and listen to the city noises.\u000aI am glad to see Hell's Kitchen is getting more hotels and restaurants, and the Fairfield is a great addition to the neighborhood. Try Tavola on 9th Ave. between 37th & 38th Streets, and Mercato on West 39th between 8th & 9th. Mercato is quite small; go early or call first. Tavola has the best darn gnocchi! Love it.\u000aI would totally stay at the Fairfield Inn Penn Station again. I don't give it 5 stars because it's not a 5-star property. It's a fantastic value, though.

VTook a quick over night trip to New York City. Having never visited NYC, I did not know what to expect of this hotel. I was a bit surprised when comparing prices of some of the hotels and prepared myself for less than stellar accommodations. We were pleased with this choice. The lobby has recently been refreshed. One of our main reason for picking this hotel was it's close proximity to Penn Station, such an easy walk. Check in was quick and pleasant and our room was ready early (a great thing since we wanted to sight-see). I was a bit concerned about the location of the room after reading reviews. We were on a higher floor and away from lifts, a plus. We did not have noise issues with the fire station nearby. We were on the 8th floor in room 822 (this room has no views outside the window). The room decor was nice and cheery and everything clean and tidy. Beds are a bit firm for my taste, but after all our walking we slept well. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and have already recommended to friends. Travel tip: if sight-seeing after check out, Affinia will hold your luggage if you have plans after check out time. Had a great visit and in part was due to a restful sleep at the Affinia!

VWe purchased this investment 4 years ago after coming to NYC every Christmas season with the family and my Mother. We always needed to get two rooms in Times Square at $500+ for each night. Most nights would cost $1,200 for both rooms. So we looked into purchasing at this location. YES, it is very costly to purchase here. The dues are also expensive BUT it is in a wonderful area, the staff is AMAZING, the owners lounge is wonderful and the room we get every year - a one bedroom premium - is fabulous! Some of them even have balconies that run the entire length of the room to sit out on and watch the city do what the city does best....entertain! We love our investment.

VWhat a great spot in the city that never sleeps, opposite the famous Madison Square Garden, a walk to times square and Macey's. Sat on 7th it is easy access to all of the city. Not a bad welcome but not great at front desk on arrival, but hey ho, for us travellers it was 3 am UK time, so a long day, which can make some a little cranky. We were given our room access cards and pointed to the lifts. Perhaps I expected too much......the rooms were pokey but ok I guess for a city break. The bathroom was....adequate, but I do have an issue almost reversing in to use the loo!! Rooms were cleaned and fresh towels were done daily, so no issues there. We had a room at the front of the hotel, 16th floor which seemed great at the time, but NY city never sleeps, so neither did we. Police cars, fire engines, Ambulance and taxi horns certainly made sure of that!! If we had a choice we should have got a room at the back of the place.\u000aOne major thing to remember is the fees that the hotel WILL take from you. I had an issue with my debit card as the hotel tried to take $50 each day for whatever reason. This caused a fraud alert on the account and the card was blocked. Bit of a pain but easily sorted after a 20 minute call to the bank. Reception said they took the money then repaid it after you check out (days after!). I dont mind but was never told about this, so please ensure you are aware of this.

VAfter reading reviews and having 3 pre visit emails ignored I was wondering why we booked. We arrived at 10pm after a long journey from UK and our bodies were really telling us it was 5am to be told they'd had a leak and our room was unavailable. (No room at the inn - how very seasonal!)!They offered us a single bed for my adult daughter and I to share. We quietly refused this showing her our pre paid confirmation voucher for a queen room (she disputed the fact we had booked this as it didn't show on her screen) and asked if we would get our money reimbursed The receptionist told us she couldn't do this and we had to wait to see the manager. We did and he was polite and apologetic. His doorman took us to a taxi and ensured we would get a receipt and we were taken to a sister hotel which was a disappointment but we were so tired we just wanted to sleep. The Paramount phoned ahead and gave us a letter for the other hotel.\u000aWe returned at 7am the following morning and our taxis were reimbursed, the sister hotel was paid for by the paramount and we were upgraded for out remaining 4 nights. They have also promised to reimburse BA for our first night who should in turn reimburse us.\u000aThe Lobby is dark but atmospheric, the staff (save the night receptionist) were all polite, friendly and helpful especially the lady in the lifts and the gentleman who sought our taxi\u000aOur upgraded room was clean, had two double beds and an adequate bathroom. There was ample room as I used the wardrobe but my daughter infuriatingly insists on living out of a suitcase and there was room for her to do this without getting in my way!! The wardrobe probably would be snug for more than one persons attire\u000aThe location is perfect and we felt safe

Close to transport, walking distance to many places such as Rockefeller Centre and theatre district. Reasonable food options nearby. Stylish decor.

VI loved my stay overall, but spending $600 a night I don't think they should be doing a timeshare sales pitch throughout! Tacky! They actually even called me before my stay to suggest I set up a time during my visit to hear about their concept and then left me messages in my room. Overall i liked the location, the rooms have nice hardwood floors, breakfast was included and was terrific, workout facility was nice set up with plenty of equipment. I liked the place overall but have no interest in buying!!!!

VLocation of the hotel is excellent being mid-town close to underground, also easy to reach from airport saving the taxi money :) Althogh we received a smoker room for the first night - even if we checked-in with an 11 year old child and not asking specifically for such a room since we do not smoke - once we asked to be moved, our request was answered and we reived a new room for the next 3 nights. We found the rooms clean, AC functioning well, people at reception willing to support and being very pleasant. Overall, a very good experience and we would choose this hotel again.

VWe recently stayed at The Jewel. This is a great little hotel! Wonderful value for the money. We booked it using Hotwire and really lucked out being able to stay here! We would definitely stay here again. From the Hotel entrance you can see 30 Rockefellar plaza (where they have the big Christmas tree/ice skating). This hotel has a great little lounge where they offer complimentary coffee and tea in the morning. They also have complimentary computers/internet in their lounge as well as 2 charging stations for just about any phone, so if you forget your charger you'll most likely be set. They also offer complimentary printing. You can print your boarding pass for your flight which was really nice. On each floor they also have a water station where you can grab complimentary bottles of water - they was really appreciated and we got a lot of use out of this. Our room was small, but as other reviewers mentioned...it was very well laid out and comfortable. we had 1 queen bed and it was plenty of room for my husband and I. You really couldn't beat the location - it was only a few blocks from Times Square and well within walking distance to many of the main locations. The staff was very helpful. We forgot our camera charger and while the hotel did not have the right cord for us to charge they recommended a camera store very close by: H and B digital on 46th St between 5th & 6th ave and they ended up charging our camera battery for free for a couple of hours while we went sightseeing. We bought a disposable camera to use while ours was charging and they did not overcharge for that. If we ever go back I will want to stay here again!

VWe stayed at the Algonquin over Memorial Day weekend. It was the first time there since the renovations. Marriott has refurbished it while preserving and enhancing the character of the hotel that played such a role in 20th century writing, literature, and intellectual life. Like most New York hotels, the rooms are comparatively small. However, they are well appointed and very comfortable. The famous lobby and Roundtable area are intact and quite enjoyable. The staff were very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. We also had the pre-theatre prix fixe dinner. It was excellent and, by New York standards, a real bargain. We had two minor problems during our stay. One was with a reading light and the other was with television brightness. The light was fixed quickly but the television problem was not resolved. Aside from this, our stay was wonderful.

There's a good-quality simple buffet for breakfast and a nice array of cheese and crackers and drinkable wine in the early evening.\u000aThere's a roof garden as well, but since the temperature only got above freezing when the rains came, I only stepped out on it once, and not for long.\u000aVery much recommended.

VMy partner and myself arrived on the 11th of December 2015, after a long day of travelling we arrived at the hotel only to find that the hotel had no record of our reservation. After presenting the receptionist with an itinerary and proof of booking, she was helpful and put us in an empty room over night. The next morning we returned to the reception desk and the matter has been resolved overnight. (The booking had been placed with a spelling mistake by the travel agents.)\u000aWe were moved to another room on the 6th floor immediately.\u000aThe rooms are very clean yet basic; personally I'd say it's ideal for a cheap city break as long as you're not expecting anything special. It had all we needed and did the job as we were out the whole day.\u000aThe (shared) bathrooms were clean but slightly outdated and needed a bit of work.However, this would not stop me from staying there again. Both bedrooms and bathrooms were cleaned everyday.\u000aWe checked out on the 16th of December by 11am, our flight was not until late at night. The receptionist gave us a key to a luggage holding room downstairs where we stored out cases while we spent the last day exploring.\u000aOverall we had an enjoyable stay and would recommend it to anyone trying to visit New York on a budget!

VThere are no words to describe the incredible experience I had at the Stewart Hotel. I went with my husband and two daughters and we had two separate rooms. Upon our arrival after an extremely stressful week we were greeted by Andrew and Eugy. It was an immediate feeling of welcome. Andrew insisted on giving us a very big upgrade into a large suite with two bathrooms, large living room, kitchen and two separate beds for my daughters. It was beautiful and they felt like they had their very own apartment. He told them to grab a treat from the concession store as well. In addition when he saw the state my husband was in when he arrived ( shortly after us) he immediately upgraded our room to a spectacular suite with kitchen, living room and bedroom and quickly grabbed two bottles of wine and gave them to us to have in our room. Eugy was right there with him and me and my family (who have recently been though so much) were suddenly transported to heaven by these people. It was so wonderful to see the smiles on my daughters faces. It does not take much to be kind, yet it has become a lost art these days. When I called to find out where I should write a review Na Na answered and was so gracious and accommodating while answering my questions. The rooms were great, the location terrific and very central but most of all the people were wonderful. You do not get treated like this very often today as people never go above and beyond. I will become a fixture at The Stewart Hotel cause when you find good people like this you never let it go. Thank you and God Bless you Andrew, Eugy and Na Na. You did more for us in two days than you will ever know. xo Maureen

VNice new place. Very quiet for New York. Average sized room, but I would say it was bigger than most NYC hotels which are notorious for tiny rooms. Built in computer was handy though expensive to use ($12.95/day for internet). Excellent room service dinner on the night of my late arrival, and though they told me it would take 30 to 45 minutes, it actually arrived in about 15 to 20 minutes from when I ordered. Hotel is close to many main NY attractions. 9th Avenue a block the west is more of a neighborhood than the theme park attractions of Times Square and has many good local restaurants (also cheaper), I recommend venturing over there. There is immediate access to the 8th Avenue subway station adjacent to the hotel entrance, very handy. Have to mention to the quietness of the room again, I have never stayed in a NY hotel that was as quiet as this one. Skip the overpriced hotel coffee bar, there is a take out Starbucks across 8th Avenue and 3 blocks up 8th Avenue there is a sitdown Starbucks. Junior's Cheesecake on 45th Street - 1 1/2 block away is to die for! This is a great hotel in a good location that is a cut above most NY hotels.

We loved the upper west side location which is close to subway and Central Park and museum of natural history but is quieter than other parts of Manhattan. There are great food options for all meals on Amsterdam street. We used a laundry around the corner for very affordable wash and fold service. Staff were friendly.

VFirst time in New York and it could not have been better would like to return soon. Of course I had to go through the sales program and in my opinion they should have been more informative in that everything is in walking distance from this hotel. Time square is ten blocks south. Central Park is two blocks east. The High line walk is 25 blocks south. And on that walk we found the aircraft carrier Intrepid Museum. The only thing that I would do next time is get a room a little higher because of street noise.

VI am a big fan of InterContinental Hotels and used my points to stay here last week. Everything was great and everyone I dealt with was very friendly and professional. The only two disappointments were no bathtub in my room and no spa as I wanted to relax in a sauna or jacuzzi. The location is ideal for exploring NYC, especially if you want to watch some Broadway shows. If I was rich then I would stay here all the time. Prices in NYC fluctuate a lot so you could get good deal here but my budget usually limits me to the Holiday Inn a few blocks away...

VHad to go to NYC for a day and tried this little hotel on a recommendation. Unlike my 2 previous trips there.this hotel was lower in Midtown and the neighborhood was not as nice. The hotel itself was tasteful, well appointed, with small but comfortable rooms.The staff was very hospitable and professional There was a nice sitting room in the lobby,and coffee and tea were available around the clock. A word of warning : avoid the rooms facing the street. I was given such a room and the noise was unacceptable. It seems there is construction going on until September of 2016 Fortunately, they were able to give me a room in the back, and noise was not an issue.A nice upside of the neighborhood is the fresh food Market/Cafe/Deli across the street, good for a meal or quick stop anytime. Not much else in the neighborhood.

VI have just arrived back to the UK with my girlfriend after a 10 day break. We had a deluxe guestroom which I'd imagine was pretty much the same as everyone else's, just a lot more space. The hotel is in a really good location and felt very safe walking to and from both day and night. A fair few homeless line the street on one side of the hotel but they were no issue as such. Staff were pleasant and did let me use the reception phone for a free call to the bank which would have otherwise cost me from the room- thank you staff. That said, any US room I have stayed in before have always had free calls to free phone numbers so should perhaps change this policy.\u000aThe room was a very good size and nicely decorated. However, the room standard (in particular the bathroom) does not reflect the quality that the lobby and public areas which are very nice.\u000aThe room had a couple of imperfections such as rocky lampshades, a few drill holes in the roof where a blind had been removed and one window that did not close. This meant a fair amount of noise from outside coming through. The bathroom was also poorly refurbished, had dirty grout that needed redoing, a bathtub that needed replacing, paint peeling off the ceiling from condensation and a shower that didn't work.\u000aMost will now wonder why we didn't ask to be moved... Well my thoughts are that if they don't have the quality control measures in place to see that this isn't acceptable then I fail to see how another room would be much better. I'm sure we would have been moved to another room and that the staff would have dealt with it well had we have asked but it was simply too late when we arrived.\u000aBeds were very comfy although didn't like the duvet between two sheets method at all- it may make the room easy to clean and change but its a pain to sleep with and always comes detached meaning you are laying under a duvet that obviously doesn't get washed between visits.\u000aAll in all a nice hotel, but not quite executed to the standard that photos convey. Don't take it out of your options, but don't pay 4 star prices for it!

VMy family and I stayed at the Jewel over a year ago, and we still reference it as the best hotel experience we've ever had. The location is absolutely unbelievable, and because it's a bit of a best kept secret, the price is reasonable for how central you are. The rooms, as in most hotels in large cities, aren't extremely large. They are, however, unbelievably efficient and ergonomic in the way they are furnished and arranged. The bed was one of the most comfortable I'v ever experienced in a hotel, and the staff was immensely friendly and helpful. My favourite detail? On each level beside the elevator there's a filtered water dispenser with empty bottles for the guests to fill up and take with them! So convenient as I always forget how exhausting it can be walking around NYC.

Nice quiet street but just a two minute walk to great diners, bagel shops, restaurants, subway, etc. The hotels itself was totally clean and comfortable and for the price the room was HUGE with a full kitchen and incredibly comfortable bed. Nigel and Kris and every staff person we encountered were incredibly helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to the right subway trains, and even taking our photo before we headed out to a play.

VWe arrived at our hotel at 2:30pm and it was not ready. Ok, check in is at 3pm, so we will go have a bite and they will call us when it's ready. Didn't receive the call and when we got back to the hotel we were told our room was still not ready. We are informed that there is the exact same room on the same floor just down the hall and that it's ready. I suggest that we be given a late checkout for not having the room ready on time. She has to talk to her manager, but in the meantime we are given two tokens for free espresso at their coffee shop. Happy to report they did give us a late checkout.\u000aOur room was quite nice with a very comfy bed. The room is small, but adequate. Very clean. There was no bath mat and when I called down about this they said, to use a towel. Ok, but what is strange is that on the day we checked out there was a bath mat. Also, we were missing a pair of slippers that is included with the two robes that hang behind the door.\u000aThe staff was friendly and helpful. Love the atmosphere at this hotel. They now serve food and drinks on their front patio during the nice weather. They also have a courtyard in the back to hang out. You do have to be lucky to get a seat in the courtyard. If it's raining there is some seating in the lobby, but very limited. The elevator is very very slow, so a lot of times I would take the stairs to our room on the 5th floor.\u000aLocation is OK, but there is a bit of a walk to the subway. I love the idea of being a block away from the High Line and close to the Chelsea Market. I had read other reviews about people being disappointed that there is not a restaurant in the hotel. Trust me, there are so many good places to eat close by. The Cook House across is very good and they serve breakfast, lunch, an dinner.\u000aOverall, our stay was good, but do expect a few little glitches. We mainly chose this location for being close to the High Line. Not sure if I would stay here again if I was going to spend more time in the theater district or interested in other main attractions.

The lobby is beautiful with very contemporary design and comfy seating. They have a great little cafe onsite which is perfect for grabbing a quick bite on the go. I didn't love the water pressure in the shower, but it is totally manageable. Additionally, for the size of the room, I would have added a mini fridge and had ice available on each floor.

I would recommend this place should you want to be close to the heat of times square without really being into the crowd ( and the noise). Again, excellent service.

VMy husband and I stayed here for 2 nights last week. The location was excellent for Times Square, the theater, Bryant Park, Top of the Rock, Today Show and Central Park. We walked to everything. That being said, I really do prefer to stay in a more residential area where things are a bit quieter.\u000aThe doors slam really loud at this hotel and we could hear our neighbors the first night coming back really late. Thank goodness they weren't there the following night, but we still heard doors slamming.\u000aWe had a corner room on the 33rd floor. The view was amazing and the bathroom was very nice size. The room was a bit small (normal for NYC), but we weren't there much anyway.\u000aI'd recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be close to everything.

VI stayed here for five nights with my son staying on 20th June onwards. The hotel more than exceeded my expectations. We stayed in a twin room with city view and found it was more than large enough for us , very clean with a nice bathroom (16th floor). The post office is opposite so it is quiet at night with the window closed.\u000aThe staff were all very friendly and the breakfast was adequate . The location was great- so close to many nice restaurants and walkable to most of the tourist sites . The subway was one block away . The big bonus for us was the rooftop bar which was so nice after a long day walking around . The drinks were pricey but worth it in my opinion for the view of watching downtown Manhattan in the evening . I found the area very friendly and never felt at risk while walking alone in the evening. The lifts were busy at breakfast time but not a problem for us. The reception staff were very helpful.\u000aIf you're wondering where to stay in central Manhattan I believe you would not be disappointed at this hotel.

VThe good news: the hotel is NOT garish; instead the decor is quietly bland, except for the fire place in the lobby which is lovely. The hotel is very tall, but has a small footprint, so the lobby space and floor hallways are rather compact. The room was lovely; the views, prodigious. The location was excellent, if you love SoHo (like we do.) The room could use new, fluffy towels and better bathroom products. But the real heroes are the lobby staff, especially the woman attending to the check-in process, Michael, the concierge and the doorman who came from Poland and didn't mind snow. All were smart, knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and had good senses of humor, especially given the raging blizzard which accompanied our stay.

VMy son and I stayed here for 3 nights in March 2011. The location is wonderful. One minutes walk from Macys and the subway. About 5 minutes away from the Empire State Building entrance. 10 minute walk from Times Square.\u000aThe hotel was very clean. Check in was quick and easy. The rooms are small but this is usual in New York. We had a room overlooking 35th Street. It was quite noisy due to some work that was going on close by. However, ear plugs worked well during the night. We had a small bathroom with shower. Shampoo, conditioner and body lotion was provided. The room was immaculately clean. Housekeeping did an excellent job. There is an in-room safe, a fridge to use, LCD TV, iron and ironing board. The air conditioning can be noisy, but this can be turned off at night or again use ear plugs if it keeps you awake. And there is free Wi-Fi available in the hotel.\u000aBreakfast is served just off of the main reception area. There was tea and coffee (which was available 24 hours a day), fresh orange juice, fresh fruit salad, fruit, cereal, muffins, toast, bagels, croissants all available.\u000aIt was a pleasant stay at this hotel, and I would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending it to my friends.

VAs a Hilton Gold regular (almost all my reviews are of their properties), I booked this hotel for a three night stay with my wife, looking for an alternative to the mega-hotels; it was a pricy option, but, as Californians traveling a long way, we wanted to visit in style.\u000aLet me hit the high points first. The location is great: just two long blocks to Central Park; walking distance of a mile to the theatre district (yes, we saw Hamilton!); close to many nice restaurants and bars; a two to four block walk to the Plaza Hotel, or to Trump Tower (and other scenic tall buildings), a location where we and a few thousand others happened to see the suction cup guy. Half a block from a really nice grocery store, and doors from a drug store. Carnegie Hall one block away. Also, it's close to the R subway station on 7th and the F on 6th, both one block away (subways much easier than cabs or cars of any sort).\u000aRooms on the back side (request it) are blissfully quiet, save only an occasional siren, an unavoidable NY disadvantage. The view is the back of some buildings, but one of them has a wonderful urban garden, very cool. The room on the back side, 14th floor, was a big plus for a "noise-phobe" like me.\u000aBreakfast, European style, is by entry with your room key to the second floor area. Lots of oatmeal, cereal, fruit, and bread buffet choices, including "make your own" waffles. No one could complain, unless you demand egg dishes. Completely fine.\u000aHousekeeping was great. I always leave them a couple of bucks a night; and we got plenty of Keurig packets and clean towels!\u000aThe staff is friendly and efficient. I could do without the "get your free Hilton points" timeshare sales pitches on your hotel phone message for two days, causing the message light to go on, especially since no one at the front desk seemed to know how to get the light to turn off.\u000aOur room, a "studio plus," was roomy enough with a nice bath. No real features (desk, nice TV), but completely adequate. The refrigerator really bugged me: stuffed minibar, no room to put a cold drink of your own. Worthless. Attention all hotels: leave us 3 inches of space please.\u000aFree wi fi to all, not just Hilton Gold.\u000aThe summer guest "ambience" was family reunions, there seem to be a lot of large families at breakfast, who were meeting for a summer reunion. I assume the units are mostly privately owned but rented out, although since our unit lacked any sort of kitchen, I don't quite get it; remember we skipped the Hilton Grand Vacations pitch.\u000aSo, drumroll, what's the big minus? It's that the blower for the AC/heat unit is five feet above the floor; and it's positioned so that it blows right onto the bed! Whether your setting on the unit is auto, or the alternative of fan high/medium/low, it blows like crazy, like an Alaskan winter or a tropical summer. So if there's cold air coming through the unit, even if it's 90 degrees outside, you are going to wear a jacket sitting near the bed, and have to cover up at night. I've dealt with this other places: usually the blower is two feet off the floor and you can divert by moving furniture. Not here. We had the hotel guy in the room to fix something else, and he essentially confirmed that this is how things were, and one could not alter it.\u000aMaybe most people wouldn't care about this. I think sometimes I'm getting too grumpy in my old age. But it really took the edge off the NY experience, it made me not look forward to resting in the room. We kept figuring out ways to cool of the room while we were gone, and then turn it off while there. Especially for $400+ taxes a night, I found it distressing.\u000aIf this one issue was solved, I'd stay here again gladly next time; but, alas, since it's built into the design, I'll seek the back side of another hotel for our next visit.

VMy wife and I stayed there for the first time last week (2 nights). The staff was wonderful, the room although normal in size for New York (smallish), was laid out very nicely, the bed was wonderful, with a large mounted TV in front of it, surprisingly large bathroom and good closet space. Built in USB ports next to the bed on both sides. Be sure to request complimentary Internet when you book. There is a very nice lobby work space (free computer and printer access) as well as a bar with sidewalk seating and one of the most pleasant surprises was a live piano player entertaining in the middle of the (Tuesday) afternoon. NYLO is now our go-to hotel in NYC... if you can afford it, there are some rooftop rooms with large glass windows and fantastic views. Didn't see them in person though. The only minor drawbacks were no gym (G.C. Park is three blocks away so no problem there) and no pool (which you rarely see in the city anyhow). NYLO New York is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of the upper Westside. A few blocks to the nearest subway, walking distance to great shops, restaurants, etc. Highly recommended!

VVery modern, minimalist styled hotel. For example, there is no lobby. Now THAT's minimalist! But who am I kidding - you stay here for the location. Literally 1 block from Central Park and about 30 paces from the 57st subway station. To call this location incredible is a colossal understatement and doesn't do it justice. We strolled thru Central Park before breakfast, that's how close you are.\u000aSpeaking of breakfast, this property does offer it if you're a Member. Fortunately, my sister-in-law is so we enjoyed the free breakfast each morning. The F train is less than 1 minute out the door and turn right or, walk a block west to the N, Q, or R trains, perfect to connect you to anywhere in the City.\u000aThe staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, for example, they kept our bags in the office after we checked out at 11 so we didn't have to drag the bags around Manhattan until our 8 P.M. flight. Sure the desk staff will try to sell you a Hilton Honors Membership, but that's their job. Just tell them you're not interested and they don't bother you again.\u000aThe room is small, but not by NYC standards. I've seen other reviews posted here that consider these rooms large, so it's all subjective I suppose. Your mileage may vary. My wife and I are not the type to hang around the hotel anyway. We unpack the bags, sleep and shower at the hotel, that's about it. Every other moment is spent exploring this fantastic City.\u000aIf this sounds like you then you can't go wrong with this property. It's the very best of locations without being in Times Square with all the noise and tourists. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of price vs. size of room, also because I'm not the biggest fan of extreme minimalist styling but that's just me. I understand that may not be fair given that NYC rooms are all small, and the lack of a lobby doesn't really take away from the hotel, per se, but I typically will not give anything 5 stars unless it's perfect. W57 by Hilton is about as close to perfect as you'll find in NYC.

VI got to know the Thompson Hotels years back in L.A., where their Beverly Hills Hotel offers excellent value for money, and a rooftop pool and bar to die for.\u000aI began to stay occasionally at the New York (Soho) Hotel, but never quite felt the same level of comfort. My last visit was just mess, with inept and frankly dishonest staff who had cocked up my booking, and tried to blame it on my travel agent. They kept me waiting for an hour straight of a flight from Europe (not even a cup of coffee offered to me whilst I wait), and a series of minor irritations which added up to a very negative impression overall. Plus they insist on charging you $15 a day for internet, on top of the $500 you are paying for a room. I find this inexcusably stupid on the part of the management. It's severely annoying, and why not just hide it in the room rate if you really must charge customers for a free service. Very very poor attitude. The owners have really gone to town revamping the Hotel to attract the cocktail crowd, but seem to have forgotten that they are Hoteliers. They have also now replaced one of the best Thai restaurants in town, with yet another Italian restaurant - 1km from Little Italy; smart thinking\u2026.

VWe stayed at the Warwick from Sept 3-5 - Labor Day weekend. Having received a fabulous rate ($259/night for a suite) booking directly from the hotel website on a tip from Travelzoo, I was a bit worried prior to arriving due to some mixed comments on this site.\u000aArriving on the red-eye, we asked for an early check-in. The staff were pleasant and searched for an appropriate suite, but one was not available.\u000aAfter checking our bags, they surprised us with a wonderful free upgrade to a fabulous deluxe suite on the 31st floor. A huge two room suite with nice views and many amenities. Huge marble bathroom. Everything was nicely appointed and very clean. Very comfortable beds with crisp clean bedding. We heard no street noise whatsoever, perhaps because we were so high up.\u000aThere was construction in the lobby, but that didn't bother us. The construction was to be completed around Sept 12.\u000aWe never had to wait for any of the 3 public elevators, which were tiny but worked well. (we noticed that there are 3 other elevators noted on the floor map, that back to the public elevators- we thought those would be for staff....)\u000aThe location could not be better. A couple of short blocks to Central Park and walking distance to most attractions. Highly recommend the Citypass - a discount booklet for some of the best attractions - MOMA, Museum of Natural History, Circle Line tour, ESB, etc.\u000aFound a great deli across the street - less than a block down 6th Ave toward Central Park. (Manhattan gourmet food) Nice $1.99 breakfast - 2 eggs cooked to order, home fried potatoes with veggies, toast, coffee/tea. Add 75 cents for a pile of bacon or other items. Reasonably priced lunch and dinner buffets as well.\u000aHad a wonderful dinner at a place called Brasserie Centrale - a 24 hour restaurant with a lovely large outside eating area, tasty and unique menu at very reasonable prices. Lots of locals eating there.\u000aWe'll definitely stay at the Warwick again.\u000a

VIn any other city, the Lucerne would be a run-of-the-mill hotel as it does not appear to have been updated in years, as it does not have a sexy and fun lobby bar and/or restaurant. As it is located on some pricey real-estate on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, though, it is fairly nice as it is a good value. The hotel is not overly expensive, is clean, well-maintained and staffed by a crew of people that goes out of its way to be gracious. The location is wonderful as it is near museums, Central Park and subways which allow easy access to the rest of the city.

VStayed for 6 nights in a super-king bedroom and this comfortable boutique style hotel served us well. My wife did suggest our bedroom was obviously designed by a talented chap with chaps primarily in mind - having no decent dressing table nor convenient mirror for make-up purposes. Apart from this minor irritation, the average sized bedroom proved comfortable, with a lovely, snuggly bed; contemporary style bathroom with a wet-room/shower (though no bath); sufficient storage (just); and super fast, reliable & free WiFi/Internet. Though other bedrooms seemed to have Nespresso coffee making facilities, we had no in-room tea/coffee provided. However, the helpful front-desk, sensitive to the obvious needs of a couple of Brits abroad, provided us a kettle ensuring we'd always benefit from the all-important early morning cuppa without depending on room-service. This was much appreciated.\u000aWe genuinely found all the hotel staff to be professional, efficient, and having a relaxed, informal style seemingly in keeping with general ambiance of this chilled and trendy Smyth Hotel.\u000aAlthough the area (Tribeca) is primarily residential and relatively quiet (for Manhattan), it\u2019s an ideal base to explore from and the hotel even benefits from being conveniently only 20m from Chambers Street metro station. There are decent local deli\u2019s (do check out Zuckers Bagels) and a good choice of quality restaurants in the vicinity. A restaurant I\u2019m very happy to recommend is the Smyth hotels very own - Little Park \u2013 do make sure you reserve a table as it\u2019s a very popular eatery and understandably so given the quality of its simple menu and relatively reasonable (for Manhattan) prices.

VBooked on Priceline. Was kinda freaked put at first when it popped up being at the WTC site. Once we got there they wouldn't allow our whole family in the room due to fire hazzard. So they upgraded us to a suite for only $40 a night. Which I thought was a great deal. Our room was very cool. All floor to ceiling windows that looked right down into the construction site. I could literally lay in my bed and watch the construction. Loved the room. lots of storage in the wardrobes and loved that my kids had their own area with their own area with their own tv. Having the water machine right outside the rooms was very convenient. It wasn't chilled like it says but who cares. It was there and you didn't have to go and purchase water from a store. The only drawback was the construction noise, which you kind of tune out. Overall great hotel and I would stay there again.

VBefore you read any more of my review, please do not think I have rated the Warwick as "Average" in a bad way. It was a great base for our trip, being located on 6th Ave (hence only 1 block from 5th avenue shopping and 2 blocks from Broadway and all the shows). There are lots (and I do mean LOTS!) of choices to eat nearby - we chose not to eat in the hotel for any meals as we wanted the opportunity to sample New York properly.\u000aAs for the hotel itself, it was comfortable, although the heating took some getting used to. The room (2608) was a decent size, although the view was restricted - but, for me, part of the experience of New York was being amongst the skyscrapers. The bathroom was small (think Travellodge) but adequate. The beds were VERY comfortable and the TV gave you access to more than you will possibly want, although we hardly watched anything (too much to see & do).\u000aOn a negative note, the decor was a bit "tired" and could do with a revamp, but it was clean and housekeeping looked after us well enough. There were no coffee-making facilities in the room but a coffee maker was provided on request with no fuss.\u000aGenerally, staff were pleasant and helpful, although in truth the only request we made of them was to get us a cab to the airport when it came trime to leave\u000aWe tried the bar on our first day and were rewarded with a pleasant environment & pleasant staff\u000aAll in all, I would stay here again and would recommend it, as it makes an excellent base to explore Manhattan\u000aMaybe "Average" is a little too harsh after all

VSpending a night in the city, my girlfriend and I opted for the Smyth Hotel as we never stay downtown and wanted to visit the 9/11 museum which is just down the street from the hotel. We pulled up on a busy Saturday afternoon and were warmly greeted by Patrick, who made valeting the car and getting our bags a pleasure. Patrick escorted us in and stayed with us until we were given our room keys. He offered tips as to transportation uptown that evening and even suggested a "happening" bar near the theater where our show was playing. When we checked in, we were given a room on the 4th floor. As we rarely stay in NYC, we wanted a higher floor with a view which the front desk staff accommodated immediately, moving us to the 7th flr above the adjoining rooftops. The room was spacious and well appointed with all sorts of cool extras like a Harry's razor and "adult" pleasure pkg for purchase which we didn't buy but had a good laugh about even as it set the right mood for the evening. The A/C wasn't working correctly and Tim, the maintenance man on duty, showed up w/in minutes of being notified with a smile on his face and fixed it quickly (it just needed to be reset.) We had a delicious late night snack in the sophisticated lounge off the lobby and a fabulous brunch at The Little Park Restaurant attached to the hotel. Make a reservation because it draws a good crowd starting at 11am. Gianni and Aissa happily gave us a late checkout and gave us some good tips on visiting the memorial museum. The only criticism of the hotel is that all the seating is low so if you have bad knees, beware! Otherwise, it was a romantic, sophisticated wonderful place to spend a spring weekend in downtown NYC with a particularly pleasant and caring staff.

VI booked directly with the hotel, by phone, in late 2013 for a 2 night stay in July 2014. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers, and we requested 2 connecting rooms on a high floor, with a late check out. Because we were booking so far in advance, I was told connecting rooms and late check out were guaranteed and request for high floor had been noted. These details were confirmed by subsequent phone calls by different reception staff.\u000aUpon arrival, we had been allocated 2 rooms on different floors and no late check out. After expressing our dissatisfaction, we were allocated 2 connecting rooms on the 5th floor with a 2pm checkout.\u000aAlthough the rooms were larger than most in NYC, they lacked tea/coffee making facilities and our rooms on the 5th floor were extremely noisy and dark. Furthermore, despite recent renovations, it was impossible to close our bathroom doors. Considerable force was required to close doors and they wedged in and were very difficult to open again. Problem with door frames maybe??? Toilet also blocked late one night - fortunately staff attended within 30 minutes and unblocked it. Although hotel had been renovated, it felt like a "budget" renovation.\u000aDoorman was often absent. Whenever we entered or left hotel, no staff member greeted us, acknowledged us, smiled or even enquired about our stay. On the day of our departure, housekeeping staff repeatedly knocked on our door and asked when we were leaving....even though we had informed them of our 2pm checkout on numerous occasions.\u000aThere are many other hotels in NYC. I recommend you stay elsewhere!

VAfter reading the TripAdvisor reviews, you would think that this is a special hotel. It is not. It is very average with the exception that the service is below average. The front desk staff was not particularly helpful. There is no information in the room regarding internet usage, times for breakfast or how to use the health club. The bed was hard and the elevators were frequently slow. This morning, as a large group gathered waiting for an elevator, the front desk people huddled together, not acknowledging the problem. We ended up taking the stairs. When we decided to check out 2 days early, the front desk representative didn't even ask why, but informed us that there was a $100 charge for checking out early. Read what they ask you to sign when you check in because the $100 charge was explained to me as a charge for smoking in the room. We are now at the Eventi, which is not rated as well in TripAdvisor, but is far superior. You would recognize the difference from the moment you walk in the front door and are warmly greeted by the front desk.

VIn the City that never sleeps, where noise is at levels we are unaccustomed there lies the oasis that is the Knickerbocker. The minute you walk in there is a sense of tranquility and calm, aided by the low lighting, initially unsure but after the bright lights of Times Square, day and night, it is a welcoming respite!\u000aStaff very attentive. Excellent, special mention to the concierge Robert. Exceedingly helpful. Room was fabulous and I'd recommend a room to the rear of the hotel (we were in 1520). Large, well appointed and bed linen just the way we need it after long days and nights. Rooftop bar a must as is the superb bar and restaurant. Not cheap but where is in New York! Long Island Iced Tea went down very well after long days walking the Big Apple. The hotel is ideally located, right on Times Square and next to a Subway. You can also walk up and downtown from here. Shops very close by.\u000aIf in New York again and this is highly likely then I'd go to this historic impressive hotel every time.

VWe stayed for one week at the Giraffe and I cannot praise it enough. We had a deluxe room with 2 double beds for our family of 4 (including 2 teenage daughters). Room was very attractive and of a decent size. Particularly liked the electronic blinds - it was great first thing in the morning to lazily press a button by the bed and with a clunk clunk, the blinds lifted to reveal New York. It felt like being in a James Bond film. The room also had a balcony which must be quite rare in the city. Every evening we came back after a busy day to find music playing softly and the beds turned down with chocolates left on the pillows.\u000aInitially when we arrived I wasn't that keen on the look of the main lounge area, I think it needed some softer lighting with table lamps. Although in the morning it was bustling and jolly with guests at breakfast. We thought the breakfast was exceptionally good. Wonderfully fresh food, including bagels, croissants, rolls, fresh fruit salad, cereals and yogurts - daily papers to read too. The lounge had a lovely informal feel to it in the mornings.\u000aMost evenings we made use of the complimentary wine and cheese. We tried to make an effort for this as New York can be so exhausting that it was great to get back and relax with a glass or 2 of prosecco before heading out to dinner. A pianist playing on a grand piano too.\u000aLocation wise, we thought it was perfect as it is just a couple of blocks away in either direction to the subways on 23rd or 28th street, and only 2 stops to Grand Central Station, with just one change from there to Times Square.\u000aEven though the reception desk is very small, we found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. They were only too happy to telephone various tours we wanted to be booked on.\u000aOne of the highlights of our trip was to see the New York Knicks playing at Madison Square Garden. A real showbiz/sporty extravaganza! Only about 20 minutes to walk back to hotel afterwards.\u000aGrand Central Station also just has to be seen - it is spectacular. The food market inside is a rival for the food hall at Harrods.\u000aEmpire State Building - go up in late evening. We went at 11pm (closes at 2am) and there were no queues. Wonderful night time vista.\u000aTake a 2 hour bike tour of Central Park to see all the best bits.\u000aGet half price tickets for most of the shows at TKTS in Times Square. Opens at 2 pm.\u000aEllen Stardust Diner in Times Square for singing waiting staff. Loved it. Food is extremely ordinary, but you don't go for the food!\u000aDid about 4 main sights every day, so the relaxing drink back at the hotel was very welcome.\u000aBack to the Giraffe. Do not think we could have found a better hotel. Loved it (and I am quite hard to please!)

Vwat can i say! [--] awful place, after asking around, found out so called hotel, is a housing sector, for people on low income! they rent the odd rooms out! no security, felt ill on way up to room, fears confirmed, had no window, untill workmen turned up to put in air con! sheets stained to the hilt, little black type bugs, and we also had we can only be described, as feces on the wall and blood splatters! went to office to complain, but guy had gone! on visiting bathroom, found 3 unpaying guest's in the form of cock roachs!\u000aonline, it looks gorgeous, but don't be fooled, as they've probably photoed the best room they'e got! We booked a 2 single bed room, and wen we finally found reception, guy was told, they dont even have these rooms! hang on that's what i booked!?!?!?\u000aas this was our last night and we were on a budget, we could not afford to go elswhere, plus most places were fully booked. If we could have got away with it, would have crashed in central park! We went out, got drunk and came back at the last minute, slept in our clothes, on top of bed, worst nights sleep ever, got our arses outta there by 7.00! was gonna take photo's but this place did not warrant time effort of film, but just wanted out, wish we'd taken them now. For security, we also placed our suitcases up against door, and on the flat roof we saw prescription drugs boxes! decided for your self what these could be for!\u000aVery undesireable hotel, it's not a hotel, it's a YMCA, as they have thes back in england.\u000aStay if if you want cheap and nasty, but don't! as this put a real downer on us for last day in new york.\u000axxx

VMy first stay in this historic hotel was a mix of pleasure and frustration.\u000aThe Good: my room was much larger than the typical NYC hotel and at a reasonable price (for NY). There was a small refrigerator which comes in handy on a multi-night stay. Despite being close to the elevator there was little noise. The desk did have an outlet shelf that was sufficient. The walk-in closet and small safe are nice. The doorman stood outside with me as I awaited my car when leaving early morning.\u000aThe 'Less Good:" there are only 3 small elevators for 31 floors, and on any given day only 2 work. The housekeeping in my room was very inconsistent; a prior guest's tag (2"X1") of some kind remained on the closet floor during my visit. Calls for bathroom floor rug or something else is a daily ritual. The room didn't feel dirty but I couldn't feel clean either. A young man in a suit gave me directions to multiple non-existent restaurants - guessing he hadn't walked down the street he recommended in years.\u000aWould I stay there again? I certainly wouldn't refuse to, but I would try others I haven't stayed in before first.\u000aMore attentive management could make this place very special.

VMy wife and I recently stayed at the Mark for the first time for a weekend getaway in New York. The word that pops into my head whenever I think about the Mark is luxury. From the moment we walked into the lobby we knew the Mark was unlike most NYC hotels. The staff we checked-in with was both friendly and accommodating. We got to our room, which was spacious and beautifully decorated, and decided to immediately take advantage of the marble bath, which, as it sounds, was unbelievably luxurious. Our meal that night at the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges was unforgettable and delicious. After taking an evening stroll down Madison Ave, we got back to the hotel and were surprised by how quiet our courtyard-facing room was. The bed was really comfortable and afforded one of the best nights of sleep my wife and I have ever gotten. The Mark helped our NYC getaway feel entirely one-of-a-kind.

I mean everyone was friendly- housekeepers, doorman, front desk. Rooms are very European and extremely functional. Very high ceilings and the largest showers in NYC...I kid you not. Lobby restaurant was actually great for breakfast (didn't try it any other time). Location is not too bad either, about 5 blocks to Times Square and a little further to theaters. Now- if it rains...different story I suppose. But still, for the price and friendliness of the staff- I will definitely stay here again soon.

Room comfortable, if small, and tea/coffee making facilities would have been nice but coffee shop downstairs was ok. Staff very helpful when we needed to print off tickets booked on line and book cabs. Bed comfortable but central location means it was noisy (traffic noise and beeping!).

VBeing a budget traveler I'm not a demanding person when it comes to a place to stay abroad. A roof over my head and a bed in a hostel or an inn will do. I even spent time in a cabin with only a matrass and sheet once, which was actually quite fun and adventurous.\u000aStaying at the New York Inn however, gave me a whole new perspective on the concept of lodging, I didn't new existed before.\u000aGoing to New York for the fourth time, now in winter, we thought: Why not spend a little more money this time for a good hotel? Something more luxurious. Something with a private bath. After all: it's freezing cold in february. So we paid the (for us) extraordinary amount of 100 dollars a night for wat we thought would be a decent hotel (according to the pictures on the hilarious website that is). And so, good citizens as we were, we payed in advance for the whole 8 nights.\u000aThe first night I couldn't sleep at all; lying in my bed shivering from the freezing cold. Outside it was freezing atleast 10 degrees Celcius, and there was a hole in the window. There was some heater sort of thing in the room, but it only blew out more cold air and it made the noise of a nuclear reactor. Needless to say that the next day I was ill: cold/flu, wich lasted my entire 'holiday'. I can assure you that wandering around New York with a headache, sore throat, dripping nose and aching mucles puts quite a bummer on the experience.\u000aWarming up with coffee didn't help either; 'breakfast' was available in de fastfood restaurant downstairs, were goods were being delivered with doors open constantly.\u000aAs it is said in the review under: our private bathroom was a joke. One square meter fitts all; brushing your teeth with one foot in the shower (in a very awkward position I must say).\u000aTaking a shower was hell. First half an hour waiting for hot water, then burnmarks from boiling water. There was no escape from it, since the shower was about 50 centimeters square, so running away from burnmarks meant tumbling over the toilet, hence more bruises. In the next coupple of days I learned to take showers in 20 seconds tops. And to jump from shower right into bed, since the carpet in the room was soaked every day.\u000aThe bedding was horrendous; all sorts of undefinable stains, both on the syntetic bedspread and sheets, which were by the way never changed during our entire 8 nights stay.\u000aThere was just one electrical plug, so one had to chose between watching telly, put on the heater/freezer or read by the bedlamp.\u000aThe last day of our 'holiday' my husband had serious foodpoisening, which nearly forced us to stay in our room. We decided differently: after throwing up several times, we went to the nearist ABC cinema, were we had a good nights rest in comfy warm seats. I'm afraid I haven't seen much of Clint Estwood's Letters from Iwo Jima, but wat a night it was!\u000aI read in the reviews below that lots of people, so appaled by the New York Inn, immediately left, taking there financial loss for granted. We could't afford that.\u000aWat troubles me most, reading all this, is that these people who run this infested hole, make even more money, by doing a bad job. After all: the rooms that are prebooked, payed and left, can be sold again and again and again to defenseless travelers from all over the world. These conmen collect twice the roomrate on atleast half of their rooms.\u000aThe city of New York should not only sent health inspection over there; I seriously think they should sent (tourist)police over there.

VThe pictures are truly deceptive. The hotel staff was rude and inconsiderate. This is one of the dirtiest hotels I have seen in my life! I booked this place through hotels.com, after a verbal confirmation that I would have a private bath! After seeing the hotel, and the shared bath; we were out in 10 minutes. We waited on the road, while I worked out the refund with the staff at hotels.com. The only positive side to the place, is it's location. And, by the way, it is NOT a cheap stay! One may rather stay on the streets! Thankfully we got our money back...from hotel.com; the hotel manager refused to even listen to our woes!

Seems petty but with jet lag kicking in caffeine was required!\u000aIt was my birthday and normally hotels do a little something to make your stay special - an upgrade or bottle of wine but I just got a note.\u000aIt was a great location and the rooms and bathrooms were nice but they say they are one of the best hotels in the world and this is a bit of an over sell!

Vstayed here for my wifes 30th birthday From Jan 29th until Feb 3rd.\u000aWe were early for check in by a couple of hours, so we stored our luggage and were pointed in the direction of free tea and coffee in the breakfast room, but after 9-10 hours travelling, we opted for something a little stronger in the hotel bar!\u000aWent up to the room at 4pm and were very impressed, large room, large comfy bed, big shower with 3 heads!! Had many lovely showers with all three going! Not much of a view out of the window, but its New York not the alps!!\u000aRooms were kept clean and tidy by housekeeping, fresh towels everyday and bed made. Plus they would clear up after us in our room! LOL\u000aFree continental breakfast went down well, was just what you need for a day walking around NYC. A selection of breads, bagels, croissants, pastrys, cereals and fruit were on offer, plus hot drinks and juice. We would fill up everyday at brekky which would then last us through until our evening meal.\u000aLocation of the hotel is also brilliant, Subway station at the corner of the street, dont be scared get on the subway its easy! Empire state building 1 block away. 5th Avenue shopping 10 mins away and times square 15 mins walk. Make sure on your way to times square you try Crumbs bakery shop!!! Best cupcakes ever!!!!\u000aAll in all great hotel, great staff, great location.

VStayed at the Intercontinental times square for two nights. Service was good from all the staff that we had to deal with. Of course, the location of the hotel is really close to Times Square and is within one block from Broadway. Our room was clean and there was nothing that we would complain about. They were charging about $15 per day per device for wifi, which would cost about $60 per day (my work laptop, and smart phones for me, the wife and my daughter) for us. But, the staff who brought our bags to our room gave us a password to use and we got free wifi access during our stay!! I should've given him a bigger tip!!\u000aI suggest people to not use the valet but instead do the self-park and save $$ because the parking lot is literally across the street. I researched this before checking in.\u000aOverall, a very good hotel that I recommend to anyone visiting NYC.

VWe planned a trip to NYC in October and searched around quite a bit for hotels. I saw this hotel was favorably reviewed so I decided to make a reservation. The staff was extremely courteous, granting our request for a free upgrade to a corner king room on a high floor, and giving us a late check out for free. It rained the entire time we were in NYC and the concierge had umbrellas out to borrow--which we did on several occasions. I'd have to say the best part of staying at this hotel was the bed!!! I went home and almost missed the hotel bed as it was so comfy--I slept fantastic. Even though the hotel was a block and a half from Times Square, I was never bothered by noise. If I make a trip back to NYC I'd definitely stay here again! Excellent location, comfy beds, courteous staff willing to help--can't say enough about how nice of an experience we had staying at this hotel.

VSince I was travelling alone from JFK to spend a couple of days in New York before visiting family in Seattle I decided to go for a hotel near Penn Station. This hotel certainly fit the bill! Exit the station on W.33rd Street and you are only a few hundred yards away.\u000aThe reception area of the hotel is large and airy with friendly staff and free coffee at certain times of the day. With three elevators you never have to wait long. I had a room on the 16th floor and despite previous reviews I can't say I was ever bothered by elevator noise.\u000aThe room was large by NYC standards with the usual amenities, coffee, tea, etc. I found the bed extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was also excellent with a large shower and acceptable amenities. There is a hairdryer, safe and iron/ironing board in the room. My city view was not of any "famous" buildings but was nice all the same! The free wifi worked throughout the hotel.\u000aBreakfast is taken downstairs and was reasonable with the usual choice of eggs, sausage, cold meats, cheese, buns, etc. There is enough choice that you will definitely find something you like.\u000aThe weather was great when I was there - very hot, so a visit to the rooftop bar was a must. There is plenty of comfortable seating, good cocktails and an opera singing barman! The views towards the Freedom Tower are great - at night-time too and down towards Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station.\u000aI will definitely return here the next time I am in NYC

VI've never stayed at the Warwick before, but I certainly hope to stay there again. When I visit NYC, I prefer to book a room in a hotel that has a history and is unique to the City (not Holiday Inn or Best Western). The Waldorf had a good rate also, but it's lovely to stay in a small, friendly place like the Warwick. Everything about my stay was perfect: huge King room with super-comfy bed, location on 54th at Sixth Avenue - five blocks from Central Park (north) and Broadway (south), and wonderful friendly, helpful staff from housekeeping to front desk. Special mention for concierge Robert, who was witty and offered great suggestions (loved the Astro Diner, Robert!). Thanks to everyone and hope to return eventually!

Breakfast on the sat morning was pure and utter chaos no seats no food coffee and place looked like a bomb had went off I waited a while finally got a coffee then gave up on food it was only 8.30 never even ventured down on the other 2 mornings for breakfast as it's to small an area for the volume using it all in all a very different stay to my last one here and will probably avoid this hotel when I'm back next time

I've stayed in several locations in NYC and this was by far the best fit for us. Will absolutely return.

VMy boyfriend and I stayed here on Thanksgiving weekend 2015 so we got a pretty good deal on a standard queen room. Location is great- very central! The lobby is welcoming and cozy and they offer 24/7 coffee and tea! The rooms are small and comfortable and the bathrooms are lovely- large showers with great shower heads! Cozy beds and great customer service. It's a bit noisy- you can always hear other rooms doors slamming but otherwise our stay was wonderful!

VWe enjoyed our stay here for 3 nights at the end of a transatlantic cruise. It is right in the heart of things and easy to walk to all the well known spots. Check in was efficient and helpful. We arrived early @ 10 am and were offered a room right away albeit on a low floor - we had the choice of waiting for a higher one with a better view after 3, but elected to get settled in straight away. So we have no complaints about the somewhat dark nature of the room. The bed was extremely comfortable and shower great. Coffee machine a bit awkward to use. We had lunch a couple of times at the bar of the restaurant and the lady bartender was helpful and friendly. Food excellent - elegant and sophisticated. Bellboys and concierge excellent at helping us with a problem with our pick up car to airport. (we had to wait in the elegant lobby for quite a while when it was very busy and I did suggest that they needed a few more chairs in the area)\u000aOur only complaint is the lack of free wi-fi which these days is ridiculous. I note previous managerial comment about investment in extra routers but frankly that does not wash. A high quality hotel like this lets itself done with such parsimony.\u000a

VOur room was adequate; the 2 "queen" beds were more like 2 "double" size beds. Our two windows looked onto brick walls. Otoh, perhaps that location helped keep the room very quiet at night. We didn't hear any traffic noise. The old-fashioned decor was charming, rather than dingy. We were charged for 3 bottled waters from the mini-frig; however, we didn't take anything out of the mini-frig...and 2 bottled waters were given to us by housekeeping as "complimentary." After questioning this at the front desk, the charge was removed from our bill. Our biggest regret was booking through Otel, with non-refundable prepayment. Our flight to NYC was cancelled by United Airlines so we arrived 24 hours after our expected arrival. We still had to pay for the unused room; it put a damper on our trip and on our enthusiasm for the Warwick. Dinner in the Randolph (hotel restaurant) was underwhelming. It took 45 minutes to be served one night and over an hour the next (although after waiting an hour, the cost of my soup was comped by the manager with apologies.) Once served, my dinner salad and onion soup were delicious.

VIt was my first time going to NYC with family and found this hotel close to Tribeca (actually Chinatown) but not so expensive compared with others in the midtown. But, instead of $200/night I would probably give half of that and feel better... the hotel looks big in the picture but it is tiny. No lobby, no cafeteria, nothing...very close to subway station which was a plus...the whole area stinks since lots of open markets during the day and trash at night..I came back full of mosquito bites...\u000aYoung and friendly staff, not very interested in giving lots of details. We were happy when they "upgrated" us to the "penthouse", actually the top floor with access to the dilapidated terrace with a splendid view of Manhathan (dont expect more than that). The room was big but poorly maintained but I felt strange without doors since the elevator gave "secured" access to the room (no locks).\u000aIn our last night we were suddenly waken up by a couple at 4:45AM who found access to the terrace and started a romantic scene. Although I was sorry to disrupt their project I was also in shock with their presence. In the same night we had to listen to a party coming from the building in the back, started at 11PM until 3AM...\u000aMost likely will not stay there for the same price I can stay at the chain hotel close by.

VI have stayed before in the hotel in November and based on that experience, we decided to go back to this wonderful hotel.\u000aWe took a taxi from JFK and on arrival nobody came to us and took our luggage, even in front of the luggage men, they did not even help us so that was the first negative point.\u000aWe arrived after a long flight in the afternoon and as we are a platinum ambassador member we did not have to queue with the busy reception but we could immediately check in at the ambassador check in. I did book the stay with part points part I paid so I did not expect the best room available. The lady at the desk was by the way very friendly and helpful !\u000aWe got a nice and big upgraded room on the 21th floor with a small view on the streets around Times Square. When we entered the room housekeeping was still in the room doing the finishing touches in the room.\u000aThe room was big and off course as we would expect nicely decorated and with all facilities. We got immediately a phone call from housekeeping if everything is okay in the room, and yes it was ! The bathroom had a rain shower which was very nice and enough towels. The bed was fantastic, probably one of the best hotel beds in the world !\u000aIn the evening we went to the concierge to order a New York pass for the next day, Fatima was very friendly but she was always busy so we had to wait a bit. She immediately gave us our passes and charged them on our bill but not without explaining all major sights and giving us enough documentations.\u000aWe did not have breakfast as it is never included in fares which include points so I cannot tell you if it is good or not.\u000aInternet ( WiFi ) on your own computer was included for Ambassador members but only on your own and not on the pc installed in the room. Otherwise it was an expensive rate. In the evening we got one small Evian bottle and some fruit / nuts in our room delivered. Also we got our turndown service and received the weather and some chocolates.\u000aThe next day we did some sightseeing with our pass and in the evening we asked the Concierge for a good Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. Kat ( very friendly but again very busy with guests calling and waiting ) recommended us Trattoria Dopo Teotro which was just 5 minutes walking on 44th Street. She reserved for us, she told. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation on our name or the hotels name in the computer so we had to wait just a few minutes but then we got a table, we got a table but they only began to bring the menus 15 minutes after we got our table. The meals were good but at the end the waiter charged us ( we were 2 ) 18% service charge. On the menu it was written that only parties over 6 people will be charged with that amount. We argued with our waiter, he was not at all friendly and he was very rude and egoistic . We paid the charge but we went back to the hotel to tell this to the Concierge, Kat. She was shocked but immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the waiter and the owner and explaining that we probably will be the last customers the hotel will send. But Kat did her job quit well !\u000aThe location of the hotel is fantastic with only one block away from Times square and within minutes walking from Broadway and Fifth Avenue !\u000aThe last day we got a late check out at 4PM which was very welcome ! We checked out and paid our New York passes, David was very friendly !\u000aAgain a fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel in the beautiful New York City !

VMy wife and I went here last weekend for a night out. We live in New Jersey, but with all the snow we were getting cabin fever, so we decided a date night was in order.\u000aThe lobby of the hotel is immaculate, the man who checked us in (Arnold, I want to say) was very helpful and friendly. The location is second to none, right next to the Port Authority, and a subway stop. The elevators were spacious and quick. We got a room on the 7th floor, which was quiet and clean.\u000aThe only thing I would say about this place that missed the mark was the room. It was nice and clean, but it was showing signs of age. The carpet was kinda old and flat. The ceiling was peeling away from the wall, and the window was very hard to open.\u000aNormally I wouldn't even mention these honestly insignificant problems, but for a place like this, in this location, with this star rating, I would expect things like this being taken care of. Anyway, outside of that, really nice stay, we would go back.

VI just got home from our first real trip to NYC. Like many others I was looking to stay somewhere economical in Manhattan. I ended up booking this hotel through expedia and paying about $380 with taxes and fees for two nights.\u000aThe Good things about the hotel\u000a1) Theme of hotel was pretty cool, lobby and hallways were dark yet unique and colorful\u000a2) The room appeared clean and organized\u000a3) The staff was helpful and friendly\u000a4) The 103rd and Broadway subway station is literally right outside your door\u000a5) There was a flat screen TV in our room that also had internet access and on demand access\u000aThe Bad things\u000a1) I'm pretty sure I got bit by bed bugs and had no idea what the itchiness on my legs were until I got home\u000a2) The walls in the room are paper thin and you can hear people in the halls and your neighbors taking showers / banging\u000a3) The breakfast that the hotel serves is lame and should be included in the price but its not (there is a great breakfast cafe a short walk away)\u000a4) Building is somewhat old and run down. They have applied fresh paint and cleaned it up but it is far from romantic.\u000a

VThis was our first visit to New York, and we were able to get a good price on this recently refurbished and reopened hotel. The service was very good, with the room being very comfortable with plenty of amenities provided. No coffee / tea in the room but a request for this was met positively and these were provided.\u000aAll the staff seemed very friendly and helpful, from the reception staff, bell boys and the concergie.\u000aWe used the recently opened St Cloud, the rooftop terrace bar, which is setting itself up to be an 'it' spot in NYC. The service was good but it was still early days with staff establishing themselves.\u000aThe hotel is virtually on Times Sq, right next to Broadway and the 'ball drop', so it is incredibly central for that area, with plenty of transport links.\u000aThe room was well sound proofed and the blackout blinds worked well so a decent nights sleep was achievable.\u000aThe hotel has a house car which guests are able to have access to...an Aston Martin Rapide. This might give an idea of the type of guests that the hotel is trying to attract, and if the full price for the room was charged, we would probably not have chosen it. However, that said if a special offer was available, we would certainly return.

But trade off for quaint, adorable SMALL hotel is the understaffing, so you will end up waiting for standard items like bellman carrying your luggage in from street, instant room service response (our call to order took 10 min before someone even answered - only one person on duty doing "everything.") Lobby lounge is adorable. Excellent coffee & tea service in lobby. Nice rooms. But ask to be put in one of the NEWER / redecorated rooms.

VA girls weekend was made even more fabulous by staying at the Nylo on the Upper Westside. We had a junior suite, I think it's called, with two large rooms and a ginormous bathroom for any standards let alone NYC. It;s called urban/industrial but I call it super cool. $300 got us a huge room, great meals at Serafina's that is attached to the hotel, another nice bar area (especially when the weather is good as it's open air) and a 16th floor terrace bar serving beer and wine. Stayed all across NYC and I loved this area as it's away from the craziness....and down the street from a new Marshall's and DSW if you need a quick shopping fix. Tons of space, friendly staff and a good rate. BTW...the Sex And The City bus tour was wayyyyyy more fun than I ever expected - ask for Lou!!

VThe valet was great - we parked in front of the hotel, and they have a service come and pick up the car. Very convenient. The porters at the door are so helpful, and I like that they are not in stiff suits. Unfortunately our room was not ready, even at checkin time. The front desk said we could have a free drink and wait or they would text us. We went out and returned later.\u000aWe wanted a quiet room, so the front desk suggested the suites that are away from the street. Obviously this means there is no view, but we really wanted a quiet and romantic night and have seen the NYC views many times before. And the room was very quiet. Our room was large, with a little sitting area with a couch and tv. First impression was very stark, minimalist feel. Our favorite features were the incredibly large (for NYC) bathroom and the lovely bed, which was so comfortable. Another high point was room service for breakfast. On time and delicious.\u000aI would return to this hotel for drinks or meeting friends in the fabulous bar/lobby space - wonderfully welcoming and warm. The rooms have a colder feel, and I felt like hanging some art on the blank white walls. Of course, that's the style, but I wish the rooms were done more like the public spaces.

The continental breakfast is also excellent.\u000aYou simply cannot go wrong with this place - I plan to visit NYC again sometime so I would definitely return here, everything is simply perfect!

Bathroom clean, although the tub was shallow and at times the water wasn't very hot.\u000aNice touch that they left bottled water every day. Coffee machine, but no fridge. Acceptable levels of storage, not masses but enough for the four of us. My only real gripe is the room lighting. There was only one ceiling light, which was by the door so the main part of the room was gloomy even with the various lamps on.\u000aOverall great value, particularly given the central location.\u000aThe bar downstairs is also nice with a huge selection of craft beers. Whole foods is over the road. Lots of other restaurants nearby. Huge range of shops in the vicinity. An easy 10 min walk to Penn station, or even nearer 23rd street tube which runs directly to Jamaica for JFK. Would definitely consider for a return trip.

The menu was top class and we ate twice in the restaurant. The rooftop terrace provided fantastic views.

VMy husband, 12 year old daughter and I stayed at this hotel for a week in early August. It was nice that we had a pull out chair (twin) for our daughter, but when you pulled it out, you had to climb over it to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. The room should have been set up differently. The carpet sorely needed cleaning and given how small the room was, the walls needed painting. They actually touched up the walls with fresh paint in a couple places before we checked in, but didn't bother to mention it. We discovered that after leaning up against the wall. The front desk people were very nice but maid service was inconsistent. Sometimes they cleaned and we received clean glasses, sometimes they didn't. We usually had to ask for a 3rd set of towels as they frequently only put 2 sets in for 3 people. The location was good if you desire to be mid-town and close to fifth avenue. It is a nice touch that they have water bottles and water on each floor.

There is no doubt that it is extremely well located being literally over the road from Penn Street Station & Metro line, to which we had travelled from Newark International Airport, and a few minutes walk to all the attractions of Mid-town Manhattan.\u000aThe building is a large, old Manhattan type block which has recently been refurbished as opposed to renovated. Having read previous reviews regarding noise I requested a room on one of the higher floors but was informed that my booking allocation of a deluxe room only permitted a choice of a room at that time on floors five or six. I was advised by the receptionist that room 522 was a good quiet option as it was located in the centre of the building away from the street noise. What was not communicated was that there was virtually no natural light into the room and that directly outside the window were six very noisy extractor fans from what I assume was the associated restaurant. The room was quite tastefully decorated and as other reviewers have commented ear plugs are provided. The bathroom towels on arrival were old and virtually threadbare but thankfully replaced the following day with some more that were fit for purpose. Having arrived tired after a long journey and with only a two night reservation I curbed my disappointment of the room standard and decided not to request an alternative as I did not intend spending very much time in my room other than to sleep. Had relaxation been a requirement it would have been difficult and had my stay been longer then the room would not have been acceptable.\u000aAny travellers intending to join a cruise from the Brooklyn cruise terminal be aware that the concierge, if requested, will arrange a limousine transfer which in general will cost approximately 70 dollars whereas a yellow cab hailed from the street will be about twenty five dollars depending on traffic at the time.\u000aI found the staff, without exception, to be very accommodating and helpful and the hotel includes nice touches like free wine in the foyer between 1700 & 1800 where free wi-fi access is also readily available. The associated Niles restaurant is a pleasant place to dine and not overpriced when correlated to other New York.\u000aThe Affinia Manhattan is not alone in being a very conveniently located hotel and there are numerous others in the vicinity to choose from. Would I stay there again? Possibly but I would research the alternatives beforehand.

VHad a wonderful time at the NYLO hotel. We were there as volunteers at NYC Triathlon and needed to be at Boat Basin Cafe on 78th Street at 4:30 am, so location was key. Hotel was within walking distance to Central Park and Columbus Circle, plenty of diners and shopping within a very short distance. Would stay here again in future!

VWe went for a weekend staycation at the Intercontinental. We arrived at 1PM which is before check-in time(3PM). There were multiple lines for the front desk which were not well organized. Not surprisingly our room was not ready - so we went out to walk through the city and visit some of the attractions. We left our cell phone, so they could contact us when the room is ready. After not hearing from the the hotel by 3:15 we decided to go back and check. Turns out, the room was ready - but no one thought to let us know. Unfortunately, this was only the first example of the lack of service orientation this hotel suffers from.\u000aWhen we got to our room, we wanted to get an additional duvet. We called the service line and were assured we would get one shortly. After an hour and a half of nothing, I called down again. This time I got the duvets after 15 minutes.\u000aAnother issue we had - was with the window. The window opens slightly and was not air tight. I called down to have someone come and fix the window - as a draft was coming in with sub 32 degree temperature on the outside. After waiting for 30 minutes, I called back and told the operator we need to leave for dinner and to ask the maintenance to fix this while we were out. When we returned 2 hours later - it was still not fixed. We had to call down for a third time. Only after another 25 minutes did finally a maintenance guy showed up. Even after the fix, there was still a draft, but since it was already pretty late - we opted to just bundle up and go to sleep.\u000aWhen we checked out I was asked by the front desk - how my stay was. I told them of the window problem we had. The lady at the front desk told us - "oh - well, let us know next time and we would move you to another room".\u000aIt didn't seem very convincing.\u000aConsidering the multiple failures of this hotel in providing good service and looking at previous reviews - these issues seem systemic and that they haven't been addressed at all.\u000aAll in all - for a high end brand, this is an F in my book. The repeated failures to provide timely service and the inability of the team to +1 any failure - seem like a systemic failure of leadership.\u000aConsidering the multitude of other choices in the area - you could probably find a much better value for your hard earned money elsewhere.\u000a**** for the facilies and * - for service, 2.5* rounded up.

VMy husband and I checked in for an Anniversary weekend, February 17th. Elijah checked us in quickly, and was really, really amazing about asking us what kind of room we wanted ( quiet ? A city view ? River view ? ) Upon learning it was our anniversary, he upgraded us, and later sent us a bottle of champagne. It was lovely !\u000aWe had never stayed with Kimpton before, but I used to live in Hells Kitchen, and I was really impressed with what they did with this hotel. Every member of the staff, from the desk ( Dan was amazing ! ) to the security , was great. They recommended bars to watch a soccer game for my husband, sent me to an incredible donut shop around the corner, and made a reservation at the restaurant ( Print. It was really good ! Get the short ribs. REALLY. ) We had a great time at the Press Lounge, upstairs, and even in the cold, we hung outside on the patio because it was simply that beautiful.\u000aThis hotel is dog friendly, which was pretty great. There was a water bowl by the front door, welcoming all the pets staying for the night ( with their names listed on the board. Freakin ADORABLE !!! ) We did not bring our dog, but were happy to know there were no weight limits, so even our large and wiggly Boxer would be welcomed.\u000aThere are a number of great bars, restaurants, and shops right in the neighborhood ( and Hells Kitchen is still a true neighborhood ! ) but if you want to walk to the theater, times square, The Intrepid Museum, or even the Highline, it is all with a 10 minute walk.\u000aWe were told about the wine reception, which was nice. But, my ONLY, very tiny complaint was that there was nowhere to sit while we drank our glasses. We made the mistake of going towards the bar, thinking the lounge was part of the hotel; it is not. We were shooed out of a booth we sat down in, by a nasty cocktail waitress who snapped " This is private seating , it is not for the hotel. We have a different license. you need to move." Well... truth be told, ordering a lovely round of martinis would have been perfect right then, and if she had mentioned that we would have been all over it. She didn't, so we went around the neighborhood and had cocktails until our dinner reservation at 8pm. Her loss- I was a bartender many moons ago, and I always tip exceedingly well.\u000aI really did enjoy every other aspect of our stay though.The robes were a nice touch, the toiletries were nicely scented, and everything was high end. The linens and the bed were comfortable, and the pillows were nice and plentiful. ( I hate " not enough pillows ")\u000aI was feeling a bit under the weather when we checked out ( Ok I was dreadfully hungover !!! ) and Dan literally offered me aspirin or water, and said he was upset that I wasn't feeling well. That guy, was awesome.\u000aPerdition was the bar that we went to, and Underwest Donuts was the incredible donut spot. There is also a Peruvian style rotisserie chicken place a few blocks over. Don't miss it ! All kindly recommended by Dan.

VSad to say the only thing keeping this rating from a 4 star is only one elevator was working which apparently is the norm. Waiting for it to access your room takes way to long and checking out you have to wait for several elevators until you can find one that is not full of people. Other than that the staff and rooms are excellent.

VMy husband and I stayed at the Kitano during Spring Break vacation. This hotel has a beautiful lobby and our room was very nice. We requested and received a room with a view of the Empire State Building. However the Park Ave. view would have been even nicer with all the trees and flowers that were in bloom. It rained almost the entire week that we were there, so the large umbrella in each room was appreciated. There was also a mini fridge but it was stocked full with goodies to purchase. We walked two short blocks to Grand Central Station. From there you can take subway or trains to any direction you may be headed to in the city. There was a restaurant and lounge with live music several days a week. We never ate there but the menu looked good if a little pricey. We walked to Times Square as well as many other areas, but again we were very close to public transportation. There is a balcony garden area, however it had not opened yet due to the weather. It was a quiet area but yet close enough to anything you would want to see. We would defiantly stay at the Kitano again if we ever have the chance to return to NY.

VThis past July made eighteen straight years that I have stayed at the Affinia Hotel. I work with a youth group (United Nations Pilgrimage for Youth) and we bring in 150-175 students a week. The staff at the hotel takes very good care of our students and the staff. They are always positive, pleasant, and very professional when they interact with us. Great staff, clean comfortable rooms, and great location. I would like to single out two staff members that make our stay memorable. Carl and Margaret are absolutely the best at what they do. They go above and beyond in making sure our needs are met. I have gotten to know them over the years and can attest to the fact that they take great pride in their positions and make their guests feel important. A hotel is just a hotel unless you have quality people in key postions that know how to make people feel at home--that's what Carl and Margaret do. Can't wait to get back!

VWe stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of March.\u000a1st off we had an amazing time in New York City. When we got to the hotel, the check-in staff member was busy, but we were talking to another man behind the desk who was extremely friendly and helpful. When we checked in finally we was not offered any porter to take the bags or even taken to the room to see it, we were just told to get in the lift.\u000aOnce we were in the room, yes it is small, however this is a major city with a lot of tourists, so the hoteliers want to get as many rooms to fill as possible, that said it was a lovely clean room and had ample space for a few days worth of luggage and also room to put the cases away. The bathroom was clean and compact but was again suitable for a few days away.\u000aPeople on here have also been complaining of the noise of the streets outside, all I can say to that is what do they expect it is a major city!!! the noise isn't that bad, I managed to sleep through it and my husband is a really light sleeper and he was ok with it too.\u000aThe location of the hotel is amazing, about 10 blocks from Times Square and 2 from the Empire state building.\u000aI would have no qualms of staying at this hotel again if I return to NYC.

VMy wife and I stayed there from April 20/07-22/07 to celebrate our birthdays.\u000aWe stayed in a very nicely appointed cityview room (#1010) complete with a soft King bed, down duvet and a nice marble bath. The view from the room onto 6th Avenue was partially obstructed by another part of the building, however the room was very surprisingly quiet !!\u000aIt is a fabulous location, very close (easily within walking distance) to the Park, 5th Avenue shopping and directly across from the MOMA.\u000aIf you prefer a hotel with loads of character and charm, this is definately the place for you. If you desire a sleek, modern boutique hotel then I would recommend staying at one of the W's in Manhattan (we have stayed at the W NY at 49th & Lexington). The only caveat is that you will spend substantially more on a room at the W that will be half the size of those at The Warwick.\u000aTo summarize, we would definately return to The Warwick for another weekend getaway and highly recommend it to others.\u000a

VWe recently stayed at The Warwick for four nights during the Holidays and had a wonderful experience. It was a trip to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and had only been booked 6 weeks previously. A few days before our arrival I called the hotel, and while making it clear that I was not asking for an upgrade, I simply asked if it was possible that we could have a room with a view. Upon our arrival, we were told that we had indeed been upgraded. We had a beautiful, spacious room overlooking 54th Street. Ten minutes after getting comfortable in our room a complimentary bottle of champagne and a tray of chocolate covered berries were delivered to our room. Written in chocolate on the white tray was "Happy 40th Wedding Anniversary". This set the tone for the finest hotel stay we have ever had in New York. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the doorman were friendly and not just willing, but eager to be of service. And, Randolph's, the hotel pub and restaurant on the corner of 54th & 6th, was an excellent spot to enjoy the end of the day. We have made several trips to New York and hope to make more, but we will never need to shop for a hotel again. The Warwick is our New York home.

For this occasion, we booked only two weeks in advance and the rate was way more than we've typically paid. We emailed the hotel to see if we could get a lower rate but that didn't happen. Three days before our stay, we noticed the room rate had significantly dropped and contacted the hotel while on the road and asked if we could get the reduced rate. We did. Thank you! Staff, as always, was friendly and very helpful. Rooms are small, but we're there for the location (close to friends and Zabar's) and to enjoy the city. Highly recommend!

Complimentary breakfast is served each morning for the Hilton time share owners and their guests - but one does not have to be an owner to stay here. Each afternoon, the hotel hosts happy hour also for the owners and their guests. The rooms were comfortable and clean, the shower large and modern. We had a view of the Empire State Building. Brother had a suite with sofa and sitting area. We had one room with very cushy king bed, big pillows, TV, large closet, robes, fridge. There is an exercise room and small computer room where one can work (and print out boarding passes, etc.) coffee and cookies in the lobby. They try to make it seem like your home away from home and do a grand job of it. Just steps from Central Park, MOMA, Carnegie Hall, 5th Avenue.

VThis was our first visit to New York, and we wanted a hotel close to Times Square, and this hotel was perfect for that.\u000aThe Knickerbocker is right on Times Square. A beautifully elegant building which really stands out against the new high rise buildings either side. The deep red frontage and historic windows add so much character.\u000aUpon arrival we were welcomed by the doormen. Reception is quite small, but when we arrived there were two staff on duty who were attentive and ready to receive us.\u000aWe had only booked a basic standard room, however we were absolutely delighted to receive an upgrade, not just one level up, but two grades above the booking we had made. Now that is customer service!\u000aWe had a breeze of a check-in, it was quick, efficient and provided all the information we needed.\u000aOur room was on the 7th floor facing out on to the main street with Times Square opposite. It was just the view i had wished for. Just be aware this is an old building, therefore if you are expecting floor to ceiling windows you will be disappointed as they are small.\u000aThe room had a fantastic king size bed, sofa, table, desk, large LCD HD TV, mini-bar (free sodas and water!) in room safe (free of charge), umbrella, ironing board and plenty of storage. The bathroom came with an amazing array of complimentary toiletries.\u000aI read some reviews that said it was noisy because of the traffic noise outside. I have to say apart from the odd occasion i wasn't really aware of the traffic noise. Of course when an emergency vehicle went passed you could hear it, but then you would wherever you stayed. We didn't even seem to suffer from people slamming doors in the hotel, and we enjoyed five peaceful nights sleep.\u000aOur room was cleaned everyday and the mini bar restocked, we also had a turn down service every night.\u000aFor us this hotel is excellent because of the following:\u000a1) Location, Location, Location\u000a2) Good value for money, especially compared to some hotels nearby\u000a3) Lovely room, with very comfortable beds\u000a4) Free soft drinks in the mini-bar\u000a5) Very friendly staff who are also very efficient\u000a6) Free Wi-Fi\u000a7) Use of a Samsung tablet in every room, meaning you could TripAdvisor your days activity before leaving your room!\u000aIf we go back to New York, we will definitely book the Knickerbocker, and I would certainly recommend it as a top hotel to stay in.

Not for the faint hearted late at night as undesirables hang about after the tourists have left.\u000aRooms are tiny, very minimalist as you would expect but not enough room to swing the preverbal cat and we weren't in a standard size room. I wouldn't want to spend more than a long weekend there. Public rooms and spaces are fabulous as is the bar down on street level , great to see and be seen. A great part of the New York experience .

VWe spent a long weekend here at the beginning of March and we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel has been recently refurbished very tastefully. I loved the bar and reception area, it had a lovely 'gentleman's club' feel to the place with leather sofas, bookcases, and a nice fireplace. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful and the guys at the door were lovely too. Our room was furnished beautifully and had one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in! It had almost everything you would want: towelling bathrobes, decent hairdryer, huge screen TV, well stocked bar. The only things I missed were free wifi (it is annoying having to pay for in-room wifi in this day and age) and tea and coffee making facilities. There was one point when we'd spent a long day shopping and sightseeing and just wanted a cup of tea but we couldn't find anyone serving in the bar, no-one was picking up on room service for ages, and it took several tries over a period of 30 minutes to get through. Otherwise, we both really enjoyed our stay, it's a great little hotel in a lovely location with a fantastic choice of restaurants and shops around you.

You could hear the taxis tooting and the sirens going off from the emergency vehicles, but that's par for the course in such a massive and busy city such as New York - you soon got used to it and the sounds blocked out.\u000aOnly downside? The shower could have done with being a little more powerful.\u000aWill definitely be back at this hotel when we return to New York! Thank you Intercontinental Hotel Times Square! X

VI just returned yesterday from a dazzling weekend at the Intercontinental, Times Square, N.Y. C.\u000aMy hotel room, which I shared with my daughter, was outstanding...very clean, sizable, and met all of our expectations. The service was above par, and our every need was met promptly.\u000athe Hotel is situated in the heart of the city, close to all of the theaters, restaurants, and within walking distance of MOMA, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and exciting high level shopping.\u000aWe visited the on-site Cava Brasserie, of Todd English, the day we arrived early, and while waiting for our room we had lunch, and two of our mornings we enjoyed the restaurant's breakfast buffet. The food served on all of these occasions was excellent...specially the trout salad for lunch, and the best Mimosa I have ever tasted. Eduardo our waiter, served us with his attentive and charming expertise, and a quick smile.\u000aThe doorman offered the hotel's courtesy car to the airport when we were leaving, which was the same price, almost, as the taxi, when we arrived.\u000aAll in all, I would definitely consider staying at the InterContinental, when I travel again to New York City.

Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience.\u000aAlthough hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex.\u000a

VBefore my reservation I spoke with the concierge and she was extremely nice. When we got there it was super busy, but we checked in fast and the front desk employee was nice. Our room was on the 14th floor, and it was really clean. I noticed how many reviews said the rooms were super small, so I was pretty nervous about that. But when I got in I had no problem with the room size! If you are staying in a hotel in Times Square you shouldn't be stuck in the room all day anyway. There is so much to do and the best part is that it is all walking distance! My fiancee and I walked to the heart of Times Square, the Empire State Building, and Central Park all in one day and we still had time to do much more. My family has stayed in other hotels in Times Square and paid much much more than I did at the Paramount and said the rooms aren't that big. Again, if your looking to spend all of your time in the room, and you can't deal with the noisy city, then maybe Times Square isn't a good location for you? When we got back from the city I was so pleased to have a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries in our room from the hotel (they knew about our anniversary).\u000aThe only thing I wasn't happy about was the meal I ordered from the in-room dining service. It was okay, but not good for $22.\u000aSorry if this is long, but when I was looking at the Paramount reviews I wasn't sure if I should stay there but I AM SO HAPPY I DID. Couldn't have asked for a better vacation.

VFirst off, this should only be a two star review but gets an extra star for quality of staff on reception. First thought that landing carpet had an unusual pattern but no, it was just worn right through. Room was small and needed overhauling. Windows did not fit properly and were drafty, with no amount of noise reduction. Prior requests for room on higher floor, and twin bedded room, were ignored, although we did manage to sort out the beds situation. General feeling of grubbiness with wear on furniture. Beds were decent though and it is in a good location.

VMy review is intended to give the pros and cons of this hotel. First of all, the location was great. Far enough away from the congestion and noise of mid-town, but located right next to a subway. The location also offers many places to eat from McDonalds to Jerusalem Restaurant for excellent falafal and lamb gyros, to the yummy lobster rolls and burgers at Toast - all within easy walking distance. Starbucks is next door - Rite Aid and Duane Reade across the road and Gristedes Grocery store down the block. The Upper West Side is more subdued than the touristy mid-town area and is close to Central Park and the Hudson River but just a 7 or 8 stop subway ride to Times Square. Upon arrival, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. In fact, I made a request for a room on a lower level and was granted one on the lobby level. The narrow stairs from the street to the reception desk are a little cramped and steep. The hotels "bar" area is comfortable and you can relax and wait for your shuttle to pick you up after you have checked out. Now for the actual rooms. The bed was comfortable and the room was on the small side, but was okay for just 2 nights. The bathroom is very small - to be expected in this type of hotel... in fact our friends stayed at the Belvedere Hotel and they said the same thing about their bathroom. On the negative side: bathroom needs more hooks (on back of door & walls) to hang towels, clothes, toiletry bags. An easy fix - why not do this? Would make life much easier for us travelers. By the way, the towels were clean, white and fluffy and a decent size. Definitely a plus. The carpets in the rooms is ugly and smelly and needs to go! But my main negative was the air conditioner - my god, was it noisy! Could not hear anything but the noisy air conditioning unit and made it very difficult to sleep. Be nice to get some spit system units in those rooms! Loved the ceiling fan! Overall, a decent experience and the staff really are helpful and friendly. Not luxury but decent.

VHello - Chose the Lucerne as it was near the Beacon Theatre where I was attending a show on my birthday. Arrived arrived at 4:30pm and was greeted with a glass of wine. Found the hotel to be very charming with a European vibe. Small room and bathroom but perfect for my needs. Aveda products in the bathroom are a nice upscale touch. Had a wonderful evening at the Beacon and felt safe walking alone between theatre and hotel. The next morning as I jumped in the shower and tried to adjust the water temperature, the left knob came off and near scalding water began to shoot out of the wall hitting the back of the shower and spilling onto the bathroom floor. I tried several times to re-attach the knob as water shot out with no success. By this time, the mirrors were full of steam and the floor had an inch of water pooling. I ran out of the room naked and frantic and called the front desk. I threw on a robe and within 60 seconds a bell boy came running in - looked and ran out. Next a maintenance man ran in and tried to re-attach the knob and failed. He then lay on the floor and turned the water off beneath the sink. Then two more maintenance guys come in and out of my room with towels to sop up water and a very large machine to suck up the water. I called down to the front desk to speak to a manager and was told he would call me back. It's now been 20 minutes as I sit on my unmade bed in a robe with three guys parading in and out of my room. The water has been cleaned up and there are a pile of towels in my tub. The emergency is over & they are now going to begin to repair the knob. At this point, I'm pissed and ask if they can come back later to repair the knob. They depart and I call down to management again to ask what they are going to do. I'm greeted with extreme rudeness by some man who begins to mock me and ask me if he needs to call an ambulance because I've been scalded. He is very confrontational with me and asks me what I want. I say to him at the very least, I would have expected someone other than maintenance to contact me and maybe, just maybe move me to another room to shower and provide me with a little privacy while these three guys parade through my room. He then offers me to go to another floor and shower. I'm fed up by now and ask for some clean towels and wash clothes so I can take a sponge bath. What I thought was a charming boutique style hotel turned out to be no better than service from a motel off the side of the highway. Hope you enjoyed my review.

VWe stayed at the Hotel Metro for a "babymoon" this past October. The hotel is older. The lobby is very well maintained, but the rooms are small and a bit worn. We knew this before we booked, so it was not a surprise. The location of this hotel is superb, the staff is very friendly, they have a good system for storing luggage for early arrivals and late departures, and the complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus. Bottom line, this is a great hotel for the price considering its location.

It is only a short walk away from Times Square and there are a lot of shops and good restaurants nearby. Our room was very nice, the beds were comfortable and most of the time it was not loud. The rooftop bar had a nice view but in general it did not convince us.\u000aAll in all, our stay in the hotel was good and I would return to stay at the ink48 again.

VEfficiency-style rooms with separate bedroom/living room and a small kitchen area that includes a stove. Overpriced at anything over $350 per night. Inconvenient location to public transportation - very long walk to the closest train station. Also a very long to any NYC attractions/landmarks such as Rockefeller Ctr and Times Square. In bad weather you will need to take a cab to any of these. If you found this hotel, it's very possible that you found it because you have someone being treated at Sloan Kettering. Extremely convenient location to that hospital - very short walk there and if it is priced properly, I highly recommend it for that purpose. Otherwise, no benefit to staying here. Staff is curt and housekeeping is terrible.

VWe looked up the Jewel on trip advisor and booked seeing some good ratings. It was worth every penny of it. the Hotel is located right behind Rockefeller center. ( it is not in front of it and you cannot see the skating rink or Christmas, as it seems from the description). There are 3 or 4 subway stations within 2-3 blocks of the hotel. I also found the fact that it is next to 5th ave as a very attractive proposition. Shopping, theaters and restaurants are all around the hotel. The hotel is BRAND NEW, and it has very practical set of amenities. Very efficient use of space. The rooms are OK in size, but very practical, thus making you feel the space is adequate. We stayed in a Studio which had a queen and a pull out seat ( which makes a twin bed).\u000aThe staff at the hotel are fantastic. We encountered 2 ladies during our stay Christina and Loren who worked the front desk. They were excellent, making every guest feel welcome and comfortable. Infact we had a blizzard when we were there and the city was nearly shut down, but being at the Jewel, everything was fine and the 2 ladies worked hard to keep everyone happy ( and they did!).\u000aI am looking forward to go there again during the summer and stay at the Jewel.

VI've stayed here a couple times, mostly because it has a little lower rate when others hike up their prices. This time was a mid-week stay and I got a rate of ~180+... not too bad compared to others for this date. The hotel is decent, clean rooms, bathrooms. My room wasn't big but I usually need just a place to crash after a full day.\u000aThey were doing renovations which might be a turn off to some, but I guess I look at it as at least they are putting money into the place.\u000aThe other thing that might bother some is that the windows are fairly light so sounds and noise could be factor. The hotel is in the Murray Hill area which I think isore residential. Anyway, I'm probably not the best to beninjective on this factor since I can sleep like a rock! Lol!\u000aI find rating a Location is tough because it depends what you are in the city for. it's down on Lexington, around the 30s/40s (check for sure; I just don't recall off hand) I happen to be there to see some shows so it was a little further out than I had hoped, but I love to walk so it was totally doable.\u000aNOTE: for those of you not from New York or haven't been there... don't equate distances when you're comparing Avenues and Streets in Midtown!!! The "Streets" are really close together, but the "Avenues" are huge! PLUS, they can be deceiving by starting with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., but then you get Lexington, Park Avenue, etc. thrown in between, so the distance the width of the city can be longer than you expect!\u000aHope you have a blast! And if you are a walker be sure to walk about 5th Ave to the Upper East Side and Central Park.\u000aAnd if you are Vegan, check out Candle 79 or Candle Cafe ( I may have even written a review about it! lol)

VI have recently stayed at Hotel Metro with a family member celebrating their 30th Birthday. We paid for a Premier Queen room which wasnt much more expensive and stayed on the 12th floor with a street view of the Empire State Building. You do get a bit of noise if you are street facing but that's expected in New York. It's a very busy city!\u000aThe room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. The fridge was filled with complimentary drinks and there was a coffee machine provided. The bathroom was nice and had a walk in rain shower. It was very clean and the room was attended to daily where clean towels were provided.\u000aThere was a good selection of breakfast which started at 6am-11am I think it was. Bagels, muffins, breads, cereals, pastries, fruit, yogurts as well as jams and cream cheese. Apple and orange juice as well as a selection of tea, coffee or hot chocolate.\u000aThe food in the restaurant was great and reasonably priced considering you are in New York City! I recommend the mac and cheese which I think was around $16 but worth every cent! Happy hour starts at 3pm and you can get a large glass of wine for $7 I think it was or a pint of lager for $5. The staff were lovely and chatted to us each time we were in there. Lewis and Arthur in the bar were very pleasant and made us feel very welcome. They remembered our names as well which really makes a difference.\u000aThe free wine tasting at 5pm everyday was also great and they had a large selection of wines to choose from. A nice touch and was very much appreciated after a long day of walking around the city!\u000aThe only thing I will say which is slightly negative is that the WiFi connection isn't great in certain areas of the hotel and I did have issues with this throughout my stay. This isn't a big deal though as you can get WiFi pretty much anywhere in NYC. A mention to Natalia on the front desk who was very polite and efficient and did everything she could to resolve this issue. Natalia was very welcoming and encouraged us to visit the hotel again, which I intend to in the future.\u000aAnd thank you to Johnathan on the door for weighing our luggage for us and making sure our things were kept safe on the last day! Appreciate it!\u000aOverall the experience was a positive one and I would recommend staying at this hotel. The location is fantastic, literally 1 minute walk to Macy's as well as various other shops such as H&M and Urban Outfitters if you want to shop and about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. Go to Times Square at night, it looks amazing! I didn't use the subway but there is a subway station literally outside the hotel on the right. I walked pretty much everywhere but would recommend getting a cab if going to central park as it seemed like a long walk! It was snowing heavily however which made it a challenge!\u000aGive Hotel Metro a try and I don't think you will be disappointed!\u000aThank you for a pleasant stay and hopefully see you again soon!

The desk staff was pleasant and helpful..special mention to Robert who was able to answer ll of your questions. We live fairly close so we do overnights occasionally..normally I am a Marriot lover..but this Hyatt was fine too....Not completely won over . But close. There were restaurants and lounges that seemed pretty inviting. maybe next time since we already had our agenda planned out! The surrounding area was safe and fun to explore!

VI have been going to the Affinia Gardens for 15-20 years - I am in NY about 6-7 times per year and it is my "home away from home." On my most recent visit, in early February, everything was as I was used to - the room and bed were excellent, and the staff is always very pleasant and helpful. I have recommended the hotel to many friends and everyone one of them - some of whom stayed a month - have liked it also. The fact that it has no restaurant is no problem; the hotel can arrange for deliveries to the room, and there are a number of different restaurants in easy walking distance. I often bring my wife, and the full kitchen that is a part of every room enables us to go to a local supermarket to purchase food for breakfasts and snacks.

VMy best friend and I stayed here Sept-Oct 16 for 1 week. We arrived to be pleasantly surprised that we'd been upgraded to a room with a view which overlooked Times Sq (10th floor room 1013) which was fabulous. Layout and décor of room was very stylish and the bed was extremely comfortable. Completely perplexed that a 5* hotel did not provide tea/coffee making facilities and therein began a bazar experience of what we described as 'Coffee-gate'! When I asked for this at reception they said it would be a $25 a day charge which I resented paying given the cost of our stay and was then told it would be arranged for free. We got back into hotel that night to no delivery. Having called room service asking for the beverage station, a kettle was delivered, no cups! Another 30 minutes wait (its now midnight)....1 cup was delivered! I went to reception the next morning and was left waiting by 3 members of staff for 30 minutes telling me the manager would be '5 minutes'. Eventually spoke to a manager who assured us this would be sorted out and said he'd refund us last night accommodation and arranged for some free drinks at the rooftop bar and the use of the house car (which we didn't know we could use as someone else mentioned - this was not shared with us on arrival). Still no coffee machine/coffee arrived the next day. Back to the manager who promised it all and eventually it all arrived. Finally....! One of the blackout blind stopped working (which are crucial trust me) and despite being reported was not fixed, I had to manually wind it up/down each day! A cup cracked into two once boiling water was pored into it and spilled boiling water over my feet. We ran out of toilet paper and there was no spare. The day before we left all of the drinks facilities were removed without explanation. Faulty Towers springs to mind and thankfully our sense of humour kicks in because at this point we were totally and utterly fed up of the ridiculous little mistakes that keep happening. When we checked out the one night refund turned out to be a fraction of that amount. Very disappointing but I didn't have the energy to challenge it by this point.\u000aA complimentary history book and scented candle was left for me with a grovelling apology which was a lovely gesture. Both f which I had to carry on my journey home in hand luggage as they would have taken me over my weight limit. I got stopped/searched as security at JFK thought the candle was a bomb. That kind of says it all!\u000aIts a real shame, because having read some of the book I discovered that the hotel has had a major refurb and has only been open 3 years. Location is perfect, décor is perfect, the general service lacks attention to detail and consistency. If you cannot get the little things right, it pretty much guarantees the big stuff is prone to mistakes too and for a 5* hotel I expected a lot more considering what we were paying.

VWe stayed here mid July as a family of four (2 boys aged 14 and 12). I found this hotel by going on tripadvisor and seeing the highest rated hotels. All the reviews were great to amazing. And I have to say they are all right. The place was great. A smaller boutique hotel with about 50 rooms. The rooms were clean, up to date , great amenities. We had a jr suite that looked over Park Ave and it was wonderful. The breakfast was a continental type with many options. The wine and cheese in the evening was great as it allowed us some down time before we got changed to go out for dinner. The location was close enough but also far enough away from all the touristy areas. There was a subway line which was on block away and very easy to use. I will definitely return to this hotel again when we come back next year. Thanks to all the staff who were so great and helpful in all our questions. Ie. food trucks.

Price is reasonable for the location but it is a pet peeve of mine to pay for internet in nicer hotels. Check in was smooth. Bellmen and staff were very helpful with suggestions and directions. Room was slightly dated but very nice with exceptional shower. I was on street side on 4th floor but street noise was not noticeable to me.\u000aVery nice lobby bar area. Restaurant food is very good but pricey even for NYC. All in all, I enjoyed the stay here and plan to go back with family in early fall for a few days.

VOk, well the good bit first, well situated on 7th Avenue and 31st street, within sight of the Madison Square Gardens, short walk to Macy's, Empire State, 5thAvenue etc. only other good point is spectacular views from 28th floor, oh, and the staff were very peasant and helpful. So that's it I m afraid, if those points suit you then great. But if the following doesn't then simply don't waste your time. Reception huge, weird decor and bizarre mouldings. Check in fast, very helpful. Then it starts to go lightly wrong.....the lifts (elevators) are very old, rattle about Nd make one seriously concerning noises! There's no elevator safety inspection certificate on display.quite fast though. Then the rooms. Well good grief, mine on 8 th floor was very spacious, huge in fact but it looked lie the interior had been designed by some myopic tn year olds. Colours ghastly, old air conditioning units still bolted to the walls with new ones sticking out through the windows, odd furniture, hard bed. TVs very good, decent size, and you can just open a couple of windows. There's a kitchenette too which would be good for families and I am certain the hotel could install an extra bed if you wanted, so might be good for families. Bathroom quite modern, a bit cramped takes ages for the hot water to flow through. Rooms well sound proofed which is a major benefit.\u000aParking is nearby for around 20 usd per day, be careful about dropping off outside front door, our driver had been fined in excess of 350 usd for stopping to pick up/drop some of our colleagues..and that was in a week!\u000aDifficult to sum this place up, it has pretentions to be a loft conversion type but what it really is, is an old outdated hotel that really needs a major make over.

VThis hotel is right next to the 9/11 memorial and a quick walk to the 1 and R subway lines. We had a room on the 18th floor facing the World Trade Center reconstruction and didn't have a problem with the noise at all. The air conditioner created more of a noise issue for us.\u000aThe room isn't huge, but there was still enough room for us to have one of our 28" suitcases out on the floor. Space was efficiently used in the room, and it was equipped with a coffee maker and small fridge and microwave.\u000aThe air conditioning turns off when you leave the room (but you can request that it be left on) and there is no fan in the bathroom so the room can get warm and humid. The bathroom contains Gilchrist and Soames products: conditioning shampoo, body lotion, soap, and dental rinse. Not knowing in advance that conditioner was not included, I had to go and purchase some from a drug store.\u000aOn each floor there is a water station with refillable bottles. There is also a storage closet with extra amenities such as tea, coffee, sugar, sewing kits, shower caps, pillows, blankets, and an iron. One thing I did not like was that the cleaning staff never replaced our mugs after we drank from them and instead gave them a quick wipe.\u000aThere is free wifi throughout the hotel and in the lobby, there are 2 computers to use that include free printing.\u000aWe visited the restaurant on the 20th floor once for breakfast but it was poor value. They offer a choice of a continental buffet breakfast for $11.95 or a full classic breakfast buffet for $16.95. I found that the quality and selection of food did not reflect the price and we never returned. There was also an automatic 18% gratuity in the restaurant.\u000aI was overall satisfied with my stay and would consider the World Center Hotel again in the future.

VBooked at the Marrakech since it was the only hotel could find for under $600 a night for a last minute holiday weekend trip. For $200 it was not bad. Fine for the budget traveler looking for a inexpensive (by NYC standards) hotel but would not reccomend to families with small children or anyone who does not want to climb stairs with luggage or dislikes dark hallways and rooms.\u000aPros - location is good, safe, very close to subway, decent size bedroom, clean, plasma tv and pleasant staff. Cons - no evelator and a flight of narrow stairs just to enter the small lobby, very dark in hallways and rooms, small bathroom, leaky and noisy shower, charge $2 a bag to keep your luggage after checkout and photos/website make hotel look much more luxurious than it is.

VWhat a great find in New York! I only live a Metro North train ride away, but when looking to stay in New York City for a birthday weekend, the Hotel Chandler caught my eye. It looked modern, sleek, and hip. I was right. The staff was always friendly, and helpful - nice touch with the free continental breakfast, and while they are renovating the lobby, you also are welcome to a free wine and cheese presentation from 5-8:00 p.m. (along the lines of a Kimpton Hotel Wine and Cheese) - a very nice touch. By the way, the bar, and the restaurant that are attached will be opening soon - within weeks. The rooms were CLEAN, the linen was perfect, including amazing white fluffy towels - an Ipod charger, room darkening shades, - all little extras that added up to a really nice touch. Also, they were kind enough to upgrade us to a King for my birthday "stay". The room size was adequate for New York, especially - and so cozy. All in all - this was a fantastic place to park ourselves for 3 nights of fun in New York, and the location is just a 15 minutes walk from the heart of Times Square. I would definitely stay at this property again - for business, pleasure, etc. - and will recommend to my friends and associates.

VStayed at this hotel for a long weekend and booked through the hotel website. Despite requesting two premier plus rooms months in advance on the same floor and adjoining if possible, the desk clerk was unable to fulfill our request at the time of check-in, which was about 4:30 PM; we ended up with one room on the 6th floor and one on the 23rd. The clerk said it was "just a request". Both rooms were the same price; however, the room on the 23rd floor had an expansive wrap-around terrace with table and chairs (the weather was almost good enough to use it); the other just had a street view. BTW, only the premier plus rooms have street views, but wifi is included, and you can connect more than one device, a nice feature.\u000aPluses:\u000a* Efficient and courteous staff;\u000a* Good location for our needs (theaters, Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, 5th Ave);\u000a* Clean and decently appointed rooms;\u000a* Ample sized bathrooms with decent shower heads and ability to hold water temp without freezing/scalding swings;\u000a* TVs that actually work well, with a multitude of channels available;\u000a* All-on/all-off lighting controls at entry, also individually switchable from a bedside panel and at each fixture;\u000a* Several 110V wall outlets easily accessible for chargers/etc.\u000a* Nice lounge area on 2nd floor;\u000a* Comfortable restaurant area for breakfast/brunch at typical hotel prices;\u000a* Randolph's Bar, where we gathered each day after our activities, typical prices for drinks.\u000aMinuses:\u000a* Lack of available elevators during peak exit periods. If you are on one of the lower floors, elevators going down will already be full. Their capacity is 1500 lbs but they stall at less than the rated load. I used the musty, dimly lit stairs from the 6th floor three times. It appears that at one time the hotel had 2 banks of 3 elevators, but one bank has been eliminated;\u000a* Inadequate heating/cooling units. I had to run the unit all afternoon & evening just to get the room temp down to 70F (this with an exterior temp of 50-60F), because I certainly did not want to listen to the noisy unit when trying to sleep. The room held it's temp after that with the unit off, but you will need it on during more extreme exterior temps. These are older wall-mounted units under the windows typically found in most similar hotels. Bring your earplugs.\u000aOverall, I would definitely stay here again, and plan to on my next visit.

The woman who checked us in (Marina?) was absolutely fantastic, very helpful and accommodating. She started what ended up being a great weekend! All of the staff we encountered were always helpful and polite. Yes, the rooms are small, but not any smaller than the average NYC hotel room. Ours was clean, well maintained and very comfortable. It was very quiet, very rarely heard street noise and never heard neighbors. (Room 1232). I would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you, Paramount, for a great time!

VOur room was a good size enough space for 3 people and our suitcases. The staff were very helpful with any enquiries we had for them. The hotel is in a great location. Subway station right outside the hotel. Supermarket on the right of the hotel as you are leaving about 5mins and one across the street. There is also a guy with a food cart outside the first supermarket great for a cheap snack/lunch/dinner. Good sized portions. Also try out The Halal Guys on 6th avenue 53rd street (they always have a line at their cart even at 9pm. In my opinion their food is worth the wait). I don't know why people are moaning the hotel is great for what I paid. You don't go to New York City to stay around in a hotel! If you need a place to just lay your head this is the place for you! You may also need to make sure the maid actually changes your sheets. (That was the only problem we had). Wifi worked fine. It cut out once but that didn't bother us. We just used it to call home (viber free call if other person also uses viber app and through wifi saves you a hefty phone bill when you get home) or finding directions. If you can go to Washington, D.C. For a day to see the White House and touch the moon rock at the Air and Space museum. Oh and if you are looking for dinosaurs at the natural history smithsonian does not have any. Stick to the one in New York City near the hotel they have a whole room full of dinosaurs! Also if you do go to the American natural history you DO NOT have to pay the $22 each. It is a suggested donation. You can pay whatever you like! We paid $1 dollar each. We learned this nifty fact from a New York tour guide! Hope this helps.

VI have been staying at NYLO since it was opened as On The Ave. The accommodations are excellent. From the front desk welcome, warm and friendly, to the quality of bed, from the location to the new lobby, it is hard to imagine a better value in New York.\u000aThe new mattress is exceptionally comfortable and I slept better than I have in a hotel for years.\u000aThe new lobby is welcoming and creates a warm atmosphere for people to sit and work in the space rather than in the room.\u000aThe bellman went down to the corner in the cold and wind and, during a time when there were no cabs in the area, and stayed 10 minutes hailing cabs until he finally got one.\u000aIf there is one critique that the hotel can improve, it is the absence of a ramp directly from the front door to the lobby. There is a small elevator for the five stairs but a ramp would be helpful in terms of entering with luggage.\u000aAll that said, I highly recommend the NYLO for visits to NY, especially if you are looking to stay on the Upper West Side.

VMe and my partner stayed in this hotel April 1st -5th. I had previously read the reviews about the rooms being small and this is true but manageable and as you don't spend much time in there, it wasn't a big problem. The main problem was the cleanliness. Our room had stains over the carpet, the bathroom was filthy and the bath hadn't been cleaned. We complained and they moved us to another room the following day but the staff were very rude and couldn't see why we were complaining. On arriving to the hotel we were told we had to pay a facility fee! Not only had we paid a lot for the trip, we had to pay a facility fee for things such as wifi - which didn't even work and the gym which we didn't intend on using during our stay! Not only that, on check out - they charged us $2 to store our bags!! This obviously wasn't included in the facility fee. I find it rude and disgusting that they can treat their guests like this. I would avoid this hotel at all costs. New York itself was amazing and other hotels looked lovely.

Breakfast bar had hot and fresh items but was not nearly big enough to handle the volume of guests each morning. Our one bedroom suite was on a high floor, facing the back of building and was fairly quiet. The room was a little dated, but quite clean. Window AC units both worked great (high 30's Celsius during our stay). Overall, a very conveniently located hotel in midtown for both tourists and business people.

It literally doesn't have a closing time, and the open air deck was in plain view of our room. At 1:30am the party was still raging. The 4 busy elevators make a very loud 'ding' that can be heard in the room as well. Woke up bleary eyed and restless after a very short night of sleep to take a shower and the water wouldn't heat up past a tepid luke warm. So after night one... restless sleep from loud partying until 2:30am, and an icy shower. Being moved to another room today... let's hope things improve.

VI can't fault this hotel for comfort, cleanliness and location. Couple of things - I used an international phone card to call home and was charged £8.90 for 'using' the phone. I always buy a phone card and use the hotel phones and have never incurred any charge. Since I've come home, I questioned this and apparently the charges are set out on a card in the room?Also, on check in, I presented my debit card and they authorised $400 which was immediately withdrawn from my account. Apparently, it takes 3-10 days to be recredited from checking out. I honestly don't mind hotel policy but felt this was misleading. My 25th visit to NYC and this has never happened. Again, hotel was lovely - friendly staff - but charges make me question whether I will return.

VI've stayed here several times. It has a lot of positives - the staff is always very helpful and the location is great. The beds are very comfortable, the robes and slippers are top-notch, there's good wifi, and there's free coffee in the lobby. The restaurant is new since my last visit - while it's more high-end and pricy than is ideal for just getting a bite at the hotel, the bar is nice and the cocktails are great. The problem is that a lot of the rooms just aren't up to the caliber of the hotel's ambitions - I couldn't stay in the room I was given because of some sort of strange clanging - and the elevators in the main building are very slow. The manager was very helpful in arranging a room change, though, which I appreciated. The premium rooms in the new addition are much better - central air, bigger baths, and quicker elevators. I don't think any of the rooms have views. This is a place that seems to have ambitions to be a luxury hotel, but the main building needs a upgrade to reach those standards. Of course, it also doesn't charge luxury hotel prices - so that's a benefit for a nice place in New York.

VI booked this hotel for a birthday weekend arriving in a happy mood to check-in, I was quickly disappointed to the point that I canceled all plans for the evening of the check-in day.\u000aCheck-in: Line of 4 guests when we arrived. Guests at counter were checking out and seem to have segnificant concerns regarding what the hotel billed them. but the time another agent came to check-in counter the line had over10 ppl waiting including us.\u000aCheck-in agent refused any government ID except something that has driver's licence number and date of birth. I was concerned with the request and asked for front office manager. She was rude and was making condescending remarks. I asked to see the general manager or another staff that represents the hotel in similar capacity. She went back for 30 minutes and came out stating that the management is busy and said that she will cancel my reservation if I don't agree with her.\u000aI politely responded that under the privacy act, an institution is limited to only collecting information that is needed for the service it provides and must be able to justify the need for that particular information. Especially when I offered them other government IDs. Her response was (quote): "Are you insinuating that we might misuse your information??? wait I will get someone to come talk to you.." in a threatening tone.\u000aAssistant-Director of rooms came out. I explained the situation to her and stated my concerns and asked to justify the need for such private information. Her response was different, she stated that the hotel does not need such information and any government issued ID will suffice. I offered her an ID that had my birthdate but not driver's licence information and she had no problem checkin me in. She also stated that the hotel should not photocopy or write down any of that information at check-in.\u000aShe offered me 2 rooms and asked if the first room wasn't to my liking, she will change it to the 2nd. She offered to have the bellman take the luggage to the room. she spoke with him and indicated that if I preferred to selfpark, she can direct me to the hotel-self-park arranged parking. I took her directions and they were wrong. Turned out that property was actually in-front of the hotel. I assumed it's an honest mistake.\u000aLuggage taken out of the car, all the bags on the sidewalk and the bellman is standing at the door not even offering anyhelp . We had clothes on hangers and were concerned about putting them on the sidewalk. Standing there with the clothes in our hand for 3 minutes, the bellman doesn't seem to car. I got upset and put them back in the car and decided to take them in myself. Only then the valet staff were offering the bellman's help to take them to the room. I declined.\u000aGot to the room, it wasn't adequate and decided to take the second room. took over an hour despite informing them that I needed to attend a conference call. I barely made it. and asked for the director of rooms to contact me in the afternoon or thereafter.\u000aI put the "do-not-disturb" sign as I was in a conference call. Just to be interrupted by loud knocks on the door. When opened, it was a bellman that stated it was the wrong room.\u000aIt's the morning time now and I'm still waiting for the call from someone that never came.\u000aFair to say that the stay is disappointing to say the least.

VIf you want to visit New York and have a fixed budget then this hotel is to be recommended. This city has many hotels and the most famous ones are not necessarily the best. This has many advantages.\u000a1. The location is perfect, for the main attractions, Empire State, Macy's, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Broadway theatre's are all within a ten minute walk away.\u000a2. There is a subway station at the end of the street.\u000a3 This is the big bonus it offers a complementary breakfast for guests which can save you up to $20 a day per person.\u000aThe hotel itself is clean with mostly friendly staff. Our room was bigger than some I have stayed in when in New York, but not massive. The bathroom was not huge but functional and normal services were supplied. It also had a fridge and a safe.The room was made up every day, although one day during our stay our rubbish was not taken away. Most of the rooms have been refurbished and plenty of new beds were being delivered whilst we were there. You do not visit New York to stay in your room, so from our point of view the facilities offered met with our requirements.\u000aOther reviews have mentioned noise from building works. The hotel pre warned us about this, but this is New York you get noise wherever you stay, there is always building work and traffic going on, so don't be put off by that.\u000aThe hotel has a restaurant and a bar, cannot comment on these, but it does have a good roof top garden which offers a great view of The Empire State.\u000aAll in all I would recommend this hotel for a New York visit. For the price paid it was perfect and gave a better service than many of the so called well known hotels offer in the city.

VParamount Hotel Times Square is all about location. Rooms are expensive, tiny and small, really small. Over expensive hotel to be once in a life time to spend New Year's Eve. Service is very bad, very clean rooms, but really over average prices for such 'miserable' conditions. Never to come back. Huge, but really huge disappointment. Asked for communicating rooms as I've been with family including 3 kids and gave me 2 rooms in different floors....., one with one bed and other with two beds, expecting that 3 toddlers will be alone in one room. Really disappointing.............

VWe booked this hotel due to all the amazing reviews we read. We arrived feeling pretty tired late Dec 23rd after 3 plane flights and 34 hours of travelling from Australia. We really love the Soho area and like to try new hotels which we have always enjoyed. We booked for seven nights through Tablet. The man on reception was polite but unwelcoming. He did offer us an upgrade if we wanted to pay an extra $300. We declined this but in hind site we should have taken it. Our room on the 4th floor very tiny, but lovely decor. Bed very comfortable, very clean and toiletries supplied beautiful. Michael and the others on the front door are great and also the maids so pleasant. Our view from our window was so disappointing (view of roof). What really upset us was the loudest plumbing issues which kept us awake. We could hear all around us using and flushing of the loos. Walls not soundproof. After 4 nights of poor sleep very pleasant Tiffany offered us another room which we gratefully accepted. We should have asked if there was an extra charge. We ended up paying an extra $300 for our last 3 nights. Felt really let down did not feel the vibe.

VIf you are looking for a moderately-priced NYC hotel, clean, friendly, in a great location, with FREE continental breakfast, this is the one! Yes, it is a tour hotel and you'll read reviews from unhappy European travelers, but we loved it! The king-sized room was lovely. The bed was super-comfy! The staff answered all our silly tourist questions (which they've heard thousands of times) without hesitation. And what NYC hotel includes a complimentary continental breakfast? Sure it's bagels, muffins, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee and tea ..... but, that's not bad at all!! The best part is the location is perfect ..... a quick walk from Grand Central, Fifth Avenue, Times Square, etc. This hotel is going on our 'must stay' list. We'll be back!

VWe enjoyed our 3 nights at the Intercontinental Times Square. Excellent location within walking distance to many NYC sites. Walked to the Empire State building, Macy's, Rockefeller Center, Times Square of course, most theatres, and so on. Hotel was not too crowded which was nice as we were able to get a seat in the lounge before heading out to dinner each night. Excellent service. Enjoyed the fact that we never had to wait more than a minute for the elevator to arrive which was great compared to the Mariott Marquis where we've stayed before. Hotel is in excellent condition and the beds were very comfortable. I usually don't sleep well away from home, but no problem here. Really liked the rain shower but my wife was disappointed that there was no bath in our room. She's not really a shower person. Was told that the rooms higher than the 4th floor only had showers. Compared to other high end hotels we've stayed at the room seemed a little small. Stayed recently at the Intercontinental in London and even though European hotel rooms are smaller than North America's, that room was huge compared to NYC. All in all had a great time in the big apple. Will stay there again for sure.

VI booked this hotel in january and had an e-mail confirmation from them. My partner phoned them the day before we were due to travel just to make sure all was well and they had no record of the booking at all. Further to that the attitude of the person on the phone was pretty rude. She instructed us to e-mail the manager (apparently the only way to contact him) and he would e-mail us back within 5 minutes, it's a week later and i'm still waiting. Got another hotel (city park) that was only $30 a night more and was great and in a much better location

VThe NYLO was recommended to me by a friend as she knew I liked more boutique type hotels where I would feel comfortable and relaxed whilst travelling alone, though it will also be a great place to stay with my husband next time! I needed to stay in a location near to my daughter's college and this hotel could not have been more perfect in that respect. The NYLO ticked all the boxes for me: the LOCATION was perfect with a subway stop 2 minutes away, some great restaurants , Central Park 5 minutes walk away, the Natural History Museum also 5 minutes away and my daughter's college a direct 10 minute ride from the hotel. The ROOM I stayed in was a good size with literally THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The BAR/LOUNGE AREA was relaxed with a hip, fun atmosphere so it was a great place for my friends to meet me after work. The staff were all fabulous and went out of their way to help with any questions I had, always with a friendly, courteous attitude. I'm already looking forward to my next stay there!

The staff was incredibly friendly from the moment I arrived. Everyone went out of their way to greet me, introduce themselves and offer to help make my stay as comfortable as possible.

VMy wife and I are just completing our 6 night visit to New York staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania located opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and an easy walk to the Empire State Building and Time Square - so location is perfect.\u000aThe hotel is one of those marvellous buildings that has managed to keep its heritage values, whilst updating its rooms and services. The wi-fi worked well in our room and is certainly a welcome addition to the hotel. Still problems with long queues at check in and check out at peak time, so if you can time your arrivals during the down time it would be worth while and take advantage of the Express Check Out when leaving.\u000aIf you are staying for more than two nights I would suggest paying for an upgraded superior room - one that has been updated, with better television access and a brighter newly refurbished interior - more pleasant than some of the classic rooms.\u000aWe were also impressed that the hotel has appointed an active front of house manager, Peter Gallo which has personalised what was in the past, due to the size of the hotel, a some what impersonal experience.\u000aIf you are expecting the Hiltons of the world you will be disappointed, but if you enjoy staying in one of New York Cities historic buildings with a great location, more than acceptable room facilities and normally well priced than I have no hesitation in recommending the Hotel Pennsylvania for a stay in New York.\u000aPeter Menton\u000aSydney\u000aAustralia

VWe spent 5 days at the Affinia Gardens with our 3 children, ages 7, 9 and 10. The room was huge - big bedroom with 2 queen beds, bathroom, kitchen and very spacious living/dining with a sofa bed. It was like renting an apartment but with all the hotel services (and none of the doubt that reading short-term apt rental ads gave me). The staff was so friendly and helpful, especially Caprice and Kris at the front desk. Our kids loved all the special attention they got from them, and gave them big good-bye hugs as if they were family when we left. Great location near the subway and the park. This will definitely be the place we recommend to anyone coming for a NYC visit.

VWe spent the first part of our holiday in another hotel which provided a bigger room for 4 people. On our return to New York for our last night we stayed in this hotel. The Hotel is in a great spot, clean and pleasant staff. The only negatives were the size of the breakfast room which was really far too small to accomodate the amount of traffic and our room size. We could only open 2 suitcases at a time and then could not walk past each other without one person backing into the bathroom to allow the other past. Also couldn't open the door with case open.This is impossible to see on the internet when booking. It was just by luck that our longer stay was in a bigger room. It's a shame one can't get dimensions of rooms before booking. I don't know if all rooms for 4 people are that size but for longer than an overnight stay it would be really uncomfortable. Not wanting to finish on a negative note we also booked through the Hotel Reception a car to the airport which was good value, arrived at Hotel on time even a little early and our driver was a very pleasant chap.

VThe Ramada is a good budget hotel. We stayed here for six nights. My husband and I wanted somewhere comfortable and clean and the Ramada was certainly both of these. The breakfast in the morning is good (and complimentary) and set us up for the day ahead.\u000aMy only criticism is that I did not know what AAA meant (as I am from the UK) so the quote I got with Expedia when booking it was misleading. The AAA is a the american version of AA and apparently you get a discount only if you are a AAA member. I had a heated argument with the reception lady about this and she refused to give me the rate I had booked at as I did not have one of these AAA cards (my AA card was not good enough).\u000aI even showed her my email print out that I got sent by Expedia with my booking reference number on it, the hotel address, the dates of my stay and the rate i booked at but this was not evidence enough for the receptionist.\u000aAfter this shaky and disappointing start (and 45 mins of arguing with the receptionist and manager) I decided I wasn't going to let this blight the rest of my hols and conceded to paying $200 odd more than I had originally agreed to.\u000aOK, that I have had my rant, it was a good clean hotel. Free internet and good breakfast bar that was regularly topped up and kept clean.\u000aSusie\u000a

VAfter reading that the staff were unhelpful and a bit snooty in this hotel, we were a bit aprehensive. We needn't have been though as from the moment we got out of the taxi, everyone couldn't have been nicer, from the bell hops to the concierge, even the housekeeping staff. The room was modern, extremely clean and well stocked. Being typical Brits, we wanted tea in the morning so we asked for a kettle and one appeared quickly. There were four of us in one room (all ladies) and although a little cramped we managed well. Room service was reasonably quick, but a word of warning! The portions are huge! We ordered burger and fries, toasted sandwich and fries and all were so big none of us managed to finish! Seriously though, that's not a complaint. The location of the hotel was perfect for sightseeing and we would definately go back to this hotel if we visited the Big Apple again.

VThis was my second time to stay at the Lucerne. The room (queen suite) was quite comfortable, with a frig/microwave/coffee maker, a sitting room w/flat screen tv, and two queen beds in the bedroom. This is just about the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in. It is conveniently located just up the street from the American Museum of Natural History, there is a Duane Reade across the street, and there are restaurants nearby. Mostly a residential area, with a lot of folks walking their dogs/taking kids out in strollers. Staff is very friendly, the concierge Ron is very helpful; he recommended a restaurant that we enjoyed quite a bit. We did not have trouble obtaining a cab, although they did not hover in front of the hotel 'round the clock (the gentlemen working at the door hailed them for us). The room itself has some nice granite or marble in the bathroom, and the a/c worked quite well. We had a late flight out the day we checked out; the hotel let us store our luggage at the hotel while we went sight-seeing before we needed to catch the plane. We were given a choice of USA Today or NYT each morning. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel has a nice breakfast, which we received 15% discount of (coupon given to us at time of check-in).

Needed to ship a few packages before my arrival there, and communicated with them through email for this, and they were extremely helpful. The property is in great shape, good rooms (small but as expected). The ONLY reason for which I'm not giving them 5 stars, is because house keeping did leave behind a couple of things that I would expect to be picked up... dirty coffee cups, granola bar wrappers, etc. I was provided with a survey after check out, and contacted directly by the hotel to discuss my comments, which leads me to believe and feel they really care about guest satisfaction. I would definitely stay here again.

VMy husband and I came to NYC for a night in the spring. We were looking for an affordable hotel that was in a clean and in a good location. We read great reviews of the Jewel and thought we'd give it a try. We were able to book the room for $199 a night which we thought was a good deal considering it was Memorial Day weekend.\u000aThis hotel is a bit different. Instead of a front desk, they have a kiosk where you can check yourself in. But, they always have attendants to help you with whatever you need. We got in to the city several hours before our room was supposed to be avaialble. It wasn't ready yet but they were happy to store our luggage for us while we starting enjoying the city. We came back after the room was ready. It was definitely a small room but had everything we needed. For the price, we would definitely book it again! The room and bathroom were both clean and the bed was comfortable.\u000aWe loved the location. Less than a mile's walk from Times Square and not a bad walk to shopping either. We look forward to visiting again in the future.

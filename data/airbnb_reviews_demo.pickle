S'We had a great time in New York City staying at Caroline s apartment The apartment has good space we were able to keep all the suitcases opened without a problem The location is great very close to China town little Italy and subway station Caroline is a very good host she provided us detailed information about the apartment and the neighbourhood She also responded very quickly when we had problems even though she was abroad The building is quite old the staircase is tilted one side and the door is difficult to open I learned from Caroline that the landlord doesn t want to fix The apartment is quite old the wooden floor is uneven and makes noise I think it is typical NYC apartment though I can see that Caroline has done a lot to make the room stylish industrial loft I like the total look of it When we stayed there we had the problem with washing machine Caroline was very helpful tried hard to get a technician to help us We were very grateful I would recommend this apartment to the travellers who love a rustic chic room with lots of space'

S'My husband and I were greeted by Van who was very nice and provided a lot of information upon our arrival We stayed in the LOFT The listing is described accurately with some things to point out the ceiling is low a little less than 5 feet there is NO closet space to hang or place clothes you ll be living out of your suitcase you might get a few shin bruises climbing up and down the narrow small stairs you are directly under another apartment and if you are a light sleeper you will hear a lot of footsteps and doors close early in the morning and late at night when I asked Kevin if this was typical he called back within the hour and said he d buy us earplugs for the evening I appreciated his prompt responses The neighborhood is great the location is fantastically close to everything you need most importantly the subway ll probably be willing to pay a bit more for another apartment next time due to limited space and overall cleanliness of the loft apartment'

S'Claire s house is located on a beautiful Brooklyn street is a safe neighbourhood quiet enough to hear birdsong It is well connected 5 and 15 minutes from two metro stations making both JFK and Manhattan easily accessible Claire was really helpful and allowed me to drop my bags off a bit earlier than the specified time The apartment was clean and spacious and could have slept far more than my friend and me The nearby area is great I d highly recommend heading to StoneFruit Espresso one of the best coffee shops I ve ever been to which is barely a five minute walk away As well as being a fantastic space they serve the most delicious flat whites and avocado on toast A perfect spot from which plan a day s excursion Otherwise the Fort Green and Williamsburg areas of Brooklyn offer a great mix of little cafes pizza joints restaurants and bars The area also has some brilliant street art and is the ideal place for anyone looking to experience New York who doesn t want to stay in the far more hectic Manhattan area'

S'Laura was so helpful We needed to book a place at the last minute and she was quick to respond and follow up with details about getting to her place We met her when we checked in and she and her partner gave us great recommendations about where to go They were both really nice The house has a great living area cool entertainment system and kitchen Laura happened to be away for the time we were there so we had the whole space to ourselves The bedroom and bathroom were super clean and had everything we needed The house is a little off the beaten track in a quiet part of the neighbourhood so if you want loads of restaurants and bars you can take a quick Uber ride further into the top of Bushwick or into Williamsburg It s about a 10 minute walk to the J train Gates station which takes you to East Manhattan and about 15 minute walk to the L train Myrtle Wyckoff avs station which goes to the busy Bedford avenue Williamsburg and Manhattan All in all we d recommend this place as a perfect base from which to explore the city'

S'Tyler rents out his room in apartment shared with one roommate The room is located reasonably well although the neighborhood is somewhat sketchy as evidenced by police with assault rifles walking the streets at night The fact that Tyler didn t respond in the 48 or so hours before our arrival meant we were walking around there with travel luggage and valuables at 10PM at night with no way to enter the apartment Combined with the heat this was a thoroughly unpleasant but completely avoidable experience The room is towards the back of the building There are regular parties back there and there is a church nearby meaning that there is a limited number of hours during which it is actually quiet at night altough this should come as no surprise in Brooklyn NYC The bed is comfortable and large and the room is clean However New York gets really hot during the summers even at night and despite the room facing relatively north the temperature is downright uncomfortable at night Tyler s roommate provided us with what he believed to be an AC which was nothing more than an air filter which just adds more heat leaving us sweating through the nights as well as the days'

S'This was a great place Everything was perfect for us Our family of 4 stayed 4 nights in July and it worked perfectly We even had room to have my nieces stay with us which was fun Enough beds for everyone The door had a code rather than a key so we didn t need to keep track of keys Again nice we could separate in the City and everyone could get back in the apartment The place was clean My wife was very nervous about our first AirBNB she likes everything to be clean She loved it I don t think the host lives in this place she just rents it out This is nice because my wife did not want to sleep in some ones apartment with all their stuff in it The beds were very comfortable The location is great The train the Whole Foods the park all just a block away We were able to get everywhere from Coney Island to Times Square to the Ferry on direct lines on the train 1 block away This worked really well We did a lot in the 4 days in the City I could not believe we could this much space in Manhattan for this price I priced the hotels and this place was much better It also a kitchen and washer dryer which we used I had to bring my car into the City for 1 night and there was plenty of spots within 1 block which was nice I am looking forward to another New York trip so we can book this place again The host was very accommodating to our needs She was available whenever had a maintenance man on call which we didn t need and was willing to accommodate us with a special need regarding our bags on checkout day if we needed we didn t Everything was great on our first AirBNB experience'

S'Our stay at Antonio s was great even if it was just for one night We needed a place to stay to leave early for the airport and his place was perfect for this He is a really good host he made us feel at home immediately He helped us with everything we needed telling us how to get to JFK and where to go out to eat in the neighborhood The place was clean and comfortable and even had a blow dryer which came in handy because of the cold outside We highly recommend this place'

S'Everything went as described and better than expected The space was more than accommodating The transfer of keys went flawlessly Logging into wifi was a breeze Everything was explained well ahead of time and there were zero issues Additionally the space was exceptionally clean and well managed The elevator functions well although that s not the tenant s responsibility Geographically the space is located in a great spot but that can depend on one s specific plans and activities Groceries and adult beverages can be found nearby Ordering delivery is a breeze too due to where s this spot is located It s worth noting that an Uber to LGA was 37 even during surge prices All of this is to say that it s a great spot on the island As for our host perfect'
